						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I hope you are doing well.<br />
I downloaded the openears&#8217;s newest version and for changes needed for my app, now the initialization is created in a viewController which is recreated every time I call a button from other viewController (could be the reason of the problem maybe?).<br />
So here is my problem:</p>
<p>when I create the viewController in viewDidLoad I initialize all the parameters needed like used to be in my old version.<br />
For my iPhone 6 device there is no problem recreating and initializing openears overtime I create the viewController but when I run it on iPad 2 simulator the second time I call the viewController and it initializes all the variables for openears I got an exception here and the app crashes:</p>
<pre>
err = [lmGenerator generateLanguageModelFromArray:words withFilesNamed:name forAcousticModelAtPath:[OEAcousticModel pathToModel:voiceLanguage]];
</pre>
<p>The log from openears is:</p>
<p>[spoiler]<br />

Now using the fallback method to look it up. If this is happening more frequently than you would expect, likely causes can be that you are entering words in another language from the one you are recognizing, or that there are symbols (including numbers) that need to be spelled out or cleaned up, or you are using your own acoustic model and there is an issue with either its phonetic dictionary or it lacks a g2p file. Please get in touch at the forums for assistance with the last two possible issues.<br />

<p>The last line is the one I see differences when the app runs well.<br />
Perhaps as I told you if I initialize the openears variable everytime I call the viewController is messing around something? but then should happen on my iPhone 6 also, right?</p>
<p>Thanks I hope my explanation can help</p>

						<p>I am looking for an API which can be used for the following:</p>
<p>1. add to a collection new sounds which are not words in a recognized language.<br />
2. parse an audio file and identify the positions in the file at which these sounds occur.</p>
<p>Can OpenEars do the above? If not, are there any alternatives API&#8217;s or frameworks which could do this?</p>
<p>Ideally, the API would be able to be integrated with Java or Swift code.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For Android I have been using PocketSphinx for doing speech recognition for previously recorded audio parts, a single word represented in a byte array (PCM16).</p>
<p>Can this be done by OpenEars as well?<br />
(without needed to use the microphone implementation)</p>
<p>Maybe the Android (PocketSphinx) code make my requirements more clear<br />
// decoder is PcoektSphinx decoder, loaded with language models etc.<br />
decoder.StartUtt();<br />
decoder.ProcessRaw(audioBytesShorts, audioBytesShortsLength, false, true);<br />
decoder.EndUtt();</p>
<p>var finalHypothesis = decoder.Hyp();<br />
var nbestIterator = decoder.Nbest()?.Iterator(); &#8230; etc</p>
<p>Is something possible with OpenEars for iOS?<br />
That would be great, instead of needed to make PocketSphinx workable on iOS myself.<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
Toine</p>

						<p>Hi, I use OpenEars in my project. When I compiled project to device with iOS 12 everything is good, but on device with iOS 13+ I doesn&#8217;t receive valid hypothesis from OpenEars. I got this and other &#8220;hypothesis&#8221; like this:<br />
___REJ_TH<br />
___REJ_P<br />
___REJ_NG </p>
<p>On 12 iOS I got valid words. Can you help me? Maybe, I miss some config parameter for iOS 13+, or need to update OpenEars for latest version (how to see what version I use?), or this is my fail and OpenEars doesn&#8217;t depends on iOS version or xCode version</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I read some old threads from 2012 but it didn&#8217;t really answer my question.</p>
<p>I would like to develop an app where it listens to two words and once it hears it then it will trigger an action on the app. </p>
<p>My question is can this be done when the phone is locked. For example, the user has the phone on the table and says those two words from a distance. Will openears still work? Furthermore, will this comply with apple&#8217;s policy of publishing this app on the apple store?</p>

						<p>Hey Halle,</p>
<p>Long time, no issue ;)</p>
<p>A tester of mine recently reported some strange behavior where locking the phone while OE is running causes the phone to hang from 5-30 seconds after the phone is unlocked again (there&#8217;s even some noticeable lag on the lock screen). I&#8217;ve replicated it in my app and don&#8217;t see it in the sample app (at least not as drastically) so I am wondering if I&#8217;m doing too much to help OE pause/stop/start etc, and if I should let it manage that itself more?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently testing using 2.041 on an iPhone 6s, but have replicated the issue with 2.041 on an iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Upon receiving <code>applicationWillResignActive</code> I send <code>suspendRecognition</code> and then <code>stopListening</code> to <code>OEPocketsphinxController</code>&#8216;s sharedInstance. stopListening appears to block for a long time. Let me know if I can clean-up this log further to help you read it (I added some of my own logging around my calls to OE&#8217;s methods to see which ones were blocking).</p>
<p>As always, thank you ?</p>
