		<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>Sorry, I meant another thing. I have already set FinalizeHypothesis to YES, and also I added code to delegate rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis. But &#8220;rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis&#8221; is called not exactly after user pause his speech, but after some delay (1-2 seconds).</p>
<p>Is there some other way to get final hypothesis, probably at point when we call pocketsphinx stopListening method?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

I added guard around calls to stopListening. Thanks for this.<br>
Also I can&#8217;t reproduce issue with crash for some time.</p>
<p>But I will try to do this, and give you update ASAP.</p>

		<p>Thanks for response!</p>
<p>Under same circumstances, but with mic or headset connected, Pocketsphinx works fine.<br>
Also I notice one thing: if I turn off bluetooth headset during open ears listening audio route is changed, and I receive live hypotesis. When I turn it on, I don&#8217;t receive hypotesis again.</p>
