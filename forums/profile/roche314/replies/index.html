		<p>Halle,</p>
<p>Phone info:<br>
Model: A1688 iPhone 6s<br>
iOS: 9.3.1<br>
Storage: 128GB (55GB free space)</p>
<p>Nothing special about the phone, not jail broken, it has a fair amount of apps, but plenty of free space.<br>
I also tried a fresh reboot of the phone and reran the sample app and still had the bug.</p>
<p>A colleague is also experiencing the problem.  (I believe he has an iPhone 6+ with 9.3.1)</p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to run any more tests or need more information about my device.</p>
<p>thanks<br>

#pragma mark Example for reading out Pocketsphinx and Flite audio levels without locking the UI by using an NSTimer

// What follows are not OpenEars methods, just an approach for level reading
// that I&#039;ve included with this sample app. My example implementation does make use of two OpenEars
// methods:	the pocketsphinxInputLevel method of OEPocketsphinxController and the fliteOutputLevel
// method of OEFliteController.
//
// The example is meant to show one way that you can read those levels continuously without locking the UI,
// by using an NSTimer, but the OpenEars level-reading methods
// themselves do not include multithreading code since I believe that you will want to design your own
// code approaches for level display that are tightly-integrated with your interaction design and the
// graphics API you choose.
//
// Please note that if you use my sample approach, you should pay attention to the way that the timer is always stopped in
// dealloc. This should prevent you from having any difficulties with deallocating a class due to a running NSTimer process.

// I&#039;ve provided some pretty granular information about the exact phase of the Pocketsphinx listening loop, the Audio Session, and Flite, but I&#039;d expect 
// that the ones that will really be needed by most projects are the following:
//
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidBegin;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidEnd;

// send messages to an OEEventsObserver, all that will happen is that these methods will never fire.  You also do not have to create a OEEventsObserver in
// the same class or view controller in which you are doing things with a OEPocketsphinxController or OEFliteController; you can receive updates from those objects in

#pragma mark Example for reading out Pocketsphinx and Flite audio levels without locking the UI by using an NSTimer

// What follows are not OpenEars methods, just an approach for level reading
// that I&#039;ve included with this sample app. My example implementation does make use of two OpenEars
// methods:	the pocketsphinxInputLevel method of OEPocketsphinxController and the fliteOutputLevel
// method of OEFliteController. 
//
// The example is meant to show one way that you can read those levels continuously without locking the UI, 
// by using an NSTimer, but the OpenEars level-reading methods 
// themselves do not include multithreading code since I believe that you will want to design your own 
// code approaches for level display that are tightly-integrated with your interaction design and the  
// graphics API you choose. 
// 
// Please note that if you use my sample approach, you should pay attention to the way that the timer is always stopped in
// dealloc. This should prevent you from having any difficulties with deallocating a class due to a running NSTimer process.

- (void) startDisplayingLevels { // Start displaying the levels using a timer
    [self stopDisplayingLevels]; // We never want more than one timer valid so we&#039;ll stop any running timers first.
    self.uiUpdateTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1.0/kLevelUpdatesPerSecond target:self selector:@selector(updateLevelsUI) userInfo:nil repeats:YES];
}

- (void) stopDisplayingLevels { // Stop displaying the levels by stopping the timer if it&#039;s running.
    if(self.uiUpdateTimer &amp;&amp; [self.uiUpdateTimer isValid]) { // If there is a running timer, we&#039;ll stop it here.
        [self.uiUpdateTimer invalidate];
        self.uiUpdateTimer = nil;
    }
}

- (void) updateLevelsUI { // And here is how we obtain the levels.  This method includes the actual OpenEars methods and uses their results to update the UI of this view controller.
    
    self.pocketsphinxDbLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@&quot;Pocketsphinx Input level:%f&quot;,[[OEPocketsphinxController sharedInstance] pocketsphinxInputLevel]];  //pocketsphinxInputLevel is an OpenEars method of the class OEPocketsphinxController.
    
//?    if(self.fliteController.speechInProgress) {
//?        self.fliteDbLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@&quot;Flite Output level: %f&quot;,[self.fliteController fliteOutputLevel]]; // fliteOutputLevel is an OpenEars method of the class OEFliteController.
