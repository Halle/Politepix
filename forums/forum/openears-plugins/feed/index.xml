						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This is not really an intended/supported feature of OpenEars, so I don&#8217;t really recommend it and can&#8217;t offer support assistance, but it is possible using the APIs which are intended for testing found in OEPocketsphinxController. If you take a look in the docs or header for the APIs beginning with runRecognitionOnWavFileAtPath and pathToTestFile, you can learn more about how this would work. This isn&#8217;t going to give identical results to your android code. Good luck!</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For Android I have been using PocketSphinx for doing speech recognition for previously recorded audio parts, a single word represented in a byte array (PCM16).</p>
<p>Can this be done by OpenEars as well?<br />
(without needed to use the microphone implementation)</p>
<p>Maybe the Android (PocketSphinx) code make my requirements more clear<br />
// decoder is PcoektSphinx decoder, loaded with language models etc.<br />
decoder.StartUtt();<br />
decoder.ProcessRaw(audioBytesShorts, audioBytesShortsLength, false, true);<br />
decoder.EndUtt();</p>
<p>var finalHypothesis = decoder.Hyp();<br />
var nbestIterator = decoder.Nbest()?.Iterator(); &#8230; etc</p>
<p>Is something possible with OpenEars for iOS?<br />
That would be great, instead of needed to make PocketSphinx workable on iOS myself.<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
Toine</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Sorry, there isn&#8217;t existing sample code for this and I unfortunately don&#8217;t have time at the moment to provide an example. However, it is known to work according to the instructions in the documentation and headers, so I recommend just taking some time and giving it a careful read, particularly relating to the details of how to get specific callbacks from OEEventsObserver (for instance, n-best) by changing settings in OEPocketsphinxController.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Could you please provide some code instruction on how to use the pocketsphinxDidReceiveNBestHypothesisArray function? </p>
<p>I am following the sample app codes and am interested in obtaining the n-best hypothesis and recognition scores for my application. </p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Sorry, runRecognitionOnWaveFile is an OpenEars-only method, not a RapidEars method, so it shouldn&#8217;t invoke a RapidEars callback. Have you tried it out with pathToTestFile? I am doubtful that there is a way to do exactly what you&#8217;re trying for here, but pathToTestFile will invoke RapidEars hypothesis callbacks.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>I need timing information for speech recognized in a WAV file.  I have successfully retrieved hypotheses from OpenEars.  I added RapidEarsDemo but am not getting any RapidEars events when calling <code>runRecognitionOnWavFile</code>.  I am specifically hoping for:</p>
<p><code>rapidEarsDidDetectFinishedSpeech(asWordArray words: [Any]!, scoreArray scores: [Any]!, startTime startTimes: [Any]!, endTime endTimes: [Any]!)</code></p>
<p>to be called but (based on the method name) it appears it will only be called when finished speech is detected while using real-time listening.</p>
<p>Is timing supported for WAV files or is it only available for real-time?  I will provide logging if this scenario is supported.</p>

<p>Sorry, no, there are no samples or Xamarin support, so it may not be the right solution for your needs.</p>

						<p>Do you have a demo of NeatSpeech or OpenEars so I can appreciate the quality of the TTS before buying the library or investing my time with this?</p>
<p>I see that you don&#8217;t support Xamarin, but the Xamarin TTS uses the Apple iOS TTS library which is not that good.  Presumably you would have a better solution.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Sure, it&#8217;s in the API definition â€“ it is for use while recognition isn&#8217;t in progress, if PocketsphinxController is usually doing something undesired to your session while recognition isn&#8217;t in progress. While recognition is in progress, it is expected that PocketsphinxController always normalizes to the session settings it is designed around.</p>
