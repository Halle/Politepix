						<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I last played with OpenEars, it&#8217;s great to see the enhancements and addition of sound recording testing.  I hope you are doing well, just a quick question.</p>
<p>Can a language model be used with Rejecto? Or are there any plans to add support for this?</p>
<p>Currently it uses generateRejectingLanguageModelFromArray but for future performance improvements would a language model be faster?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

						<p>Hiya and welcome back,</p>
<p>I can take this under advisement as a requested feature, but the main thing Rejecto does is create a language model that incorporates the rejection features and has the rejecting elements added to the language model&#8217;s probability calculation, so there is no getting around the requirement to recalculate the lm&#8217;s probability model even if you start with a completed one. It also has to check and make sure that you aren&#8217;t already using one of the rejection phonemes in your real model and if so remove that phoneme from the rejection model, meaning that a premade .dic would also still need processing.</p>
<p>Not saying there is no way, just that it isn&#8217;t trivial and it won&#8217;t vastly cut down on processing time.</p>
<p>If you are seeing unpleasantly slow generation for a dynamic model, maybe you want to look at this tip I wrote up which had a suggestion at the end for avoiding any repeated use of the fallback pronunciation generation technique (i.e. the slow one):</p>
