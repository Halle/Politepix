						<p>Welcome Mahesh,</p>
<p>I think it would be helpful for you to go through the tutorial to get a sense of how OpenEars works, since there isn&#8217;t a way to have accuracy issues yet if you haven&#8217;t created a vocabulary for your app: <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a></p>
<p>Let me know if you have specific questions which come up as a result of trying the tutorial, since I think the tutorial will answer the basis functionality questions and then I can probably help with the specifics.</p>
