						<p>Hello, I have OpenEars working in my application but desperately need to record the audio to file. Any example of how to do this would be helpful. Here is the approach I have tried so far which does not work:</p>
<p>ContinuousModel.mm (Line 1322) :</p>
<p>    NSUInteger dataLength = [wavData length];<br />
    SInt16 *wavSamples = (SInt16*)malloc(dataLength);<br />
    memcpy(wavSamples, [wavData bytes], dataLength);</p>
<p>/***** WRITE The WAV DATA TO FILE ******/<br />
NSLog(@&#8221;Writing to file&#8221;);</p>
<p>NSFileHandle *file;<br />
NSMutableData *data;</p>
<p>data = [NSMutableData dataWithBytes:wavSamples length:dataLength];</p>
<p>file = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath: @&#8221;/tmp/quickfox.wav&#8221;];</p>
<p>if (file == nil)<br />
      NSLog(@&#8221;Failed to open file&#8221;);</p>
<p>[file writeData: data];<br />
[file closeFile];<br />
[file release];<br />
/**************************************/</p>
<p>I have started a stackoverflow.com question for this as well: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13427619/openears-how-to-record-audio-data-to-file" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13427619/openears-how-to-record-audio-data-to-file</a></p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Maybe SaveThatWave does what you&#8217;d like: <a href="/shop/savethatwavedemo">/shop/savethatwavedemo</a>. It wraps up starting/stopping non-blocking WAV saving from incoming speech, and notifications that the file was recorded with the path to the recording as part of the notification, handles logic for suspending/resuming and other corner cases, and wraps up deleting a single recording and deleting all recordings. You can use the tutorial tool to integrate it very easily: <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a></p>

						<p>Halle, it does, and you are a sexy man! This is exactly what i was looking for. I am getting an error during installation that pocketsphinxController.outputAudio is undefined. I&#8217;m not sure how to tell which version of OpenEars i&#8217;m running. This may be a huge problem for me because I have somewhat heavily modified OpenEars for my project and it may have been based on a version that does not have this method.</p>

						<p>Right, you&#8217;ll need at least version 1.2 for plugin compatibility. Can you download current version 1.2.4, diff your customizations and reintegrate them into it? There are a few nice additions and fixes since the version you must be working with, so it&#8217;s probably worthwhile.</p>
<p>Generally the version can be found in the OpenEars.xcodeproj source files in the comments at the top, and in a file called Version.txt in the root of the OpenEars directory. Since 1.2 it is also shown in the manual and in OpenEarsLogging.</p>

						<p>When attempting to link the SaveThatWaveDemo I get the following linker error:</p>
<p> &#8220;_input_sample_rate&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      -[SaveThatWaveController bufferIsAvailable:] in SaveThatWaveDemo(SaveThatWaveController.o)<br />
      -[SaveThatWaveController pocketsphinxDidDetectFinishedSpeech] in SaveThatWaveDemo(SaveThatWaveController.o)</p>
<p>This seems to be a valid error since the variable in OpenEars 1.2.4 is actually called &#8220;input_sample_rate&#8221;. </p>
<p>Could you please provide a new binary for SaveThatWaveController.o?</p>

						<p>The underscore is part of the linker reporting, it isn&#8217;t related to the binary which definitely works with the current version of OpenEars. </p>
<p>This is an normal issue with installing the plugin &#8212; can you make sure that you&#8217;ve followed all of the steps in the tutorial at <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a> including adding the -ObjC linker flag in the right place and making sure that your project isn&#8217;t still linked to an old version of OpenEars?</p>
