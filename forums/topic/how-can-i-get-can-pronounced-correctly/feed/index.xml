						<p>Hello,<br />
My app includes cooking recipes. They often have the word &#8220;can&#8221; in them, e.g. &#8220;a can of beans&#8221;. However, FliteController is pronouncing it as the common word &#8220;can&#8221; as in &#8220;How can I get&#8230;&#8221;, which turns out surprisingly different &#8211; more like &#8220;kn&#8221;. I have tried searching the recipes and substituting &#8220;can&#8221; with combinations like &#8220;caan&#8221;, caaan&#8221;, &#8220;kana&#8221;, &#8220;karn&#8221;, &#8220;kahn&#8221;, but none of those produce a satisfactory pronunciation.<br />
I have been able to fix other issues like this, for example, I replace &#8220;cornflour&#8221; with &#8220;cornflower&#8221;<br />
Any advice on how I might do this for &#8220;can&#8221;?</p>

						<p>Hmm, have you tried two words? &#8220;CAH ANN&#8221; or something along those lines? Alternately, have you tried another voice? That&#8217;s actually a bit odd and sounds moderately buggy.</p>

						<p>Its not that odd. If you think about it, when you say the phrase &#8220;i can really do that&#8221; you pronounce the &#8216;can&#8217; in a very short &#8216;cn&#8217; way (regardless of your accent, I think), and its different with &#8220;can of beans&#8221;. So I wouldn&#8217;t really call it a bug &#8211; there is no way to differentiate the two unless you go into the complexity of analysing the context. Anyway, your suggestion of &#8220;CAH ANN&#8217; works a treat! And in my app, i am more likely to come across the &#8216;tin&#8217; can that the other one, so i am happy to go with that pronunciation. Thanks.</p>
