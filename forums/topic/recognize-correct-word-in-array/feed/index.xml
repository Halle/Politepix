						<p>Hi , First of all thanks to developing amazing API for voice recognition.</p>
<p>I have used this API for voice recognition in iOS app, all thing is working fine. But sometimes unexpected issues :<br />
EX:<br />
Step : Set ARRAY to &#8220;MARCO&#8221;, &#8220;POLO&#8221;, &#8220;DONE&#8221; etc.<br />
Step : if i test with MARCO , say MARCO , action work perfact.<br />
Step : some times say Hello, HI any other word that not exist in array.<br />
still return MARCO  OR POLO OR DONE.</p>
<p>Please find issues and help me to solve this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks Lot<br />

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This is normal for a very small vocabulary with words with few syllables â€“ it&#8217;s been discussed many times here and elsewhere so you can probably get some good suggestions by looking back through previous discussions. You may wish to investigate either using a grammar, which this blog post should give you some information about:</p>
<p><a href="/2014/04/10/openears-1-7-introducing-dynamic-grammar-generation/">/2014/04/10/openears-1-7-introducing-dynamic-grammar-generation/</a></p>
<p>But in that case you will need to have more than two words in your grammar or it won&#8217;t help with this issue, or you can also give Rejecto a try since it is designed to reduce this issue when using language models:</p>
