						<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>as i read in the forum ,normally the response it is no.<br />
But i ask it , may be i can find a solution with you:<br />

If not , there is another alternative?</p>

						<p>Basically, the situation with this is that there is one microphone (in most devices), so there is one stream of samples, and OpenEars&#8217; RemoteIO driver is consuming them. So they aren&#8217;t available for something else (like an AVAudioRecorder) to consume.</p>
