						<p>I am using flite in my app.<br />
1. How can I include only flite in my final app and not all of the framework?<br />
2. What exactly do I have to mention in my e.g. About view about politepix and flite? do I have to e.g. have all the text of the licenses in a textview?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Check out the FAQ for these answers:<a href="/openears/support">/openears/support</a></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s fine to use the text I mentioned in the FAQ as long as you link to the CMU license somewhere (either to a reprint of it on your site or on one of their sites). Conforming to the CMU license isn&#8217;t something I can speak definitively about since it isn&#8217;t my license but in my experience the goal isn&#8217;t to put long licenses into your apps but to make sure that app users can access the licenses. Thanks for paying attention to crediting and licensing!</p>

						<p>Thank you very much&#8230;I will have all the licenses in my web site and the text you have in license.txt I will have it in my About view. I think it will be correct for all of us!</p>
