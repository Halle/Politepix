						<p>I finally finished a very simple app using OpenEars and the only part I have left is the credits screen.  So,<br />
1. I couldn&#8217;t find the Politepix Public License version 1.0. to read it.  Can you tell me where it is?<br />
2. Does anybody have a screenshot of how you are crediting the CMU libraries?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

						<p>Congratulations on your app! Feel free to promote it in the sticky topic at the top of the forum once it&#8217;s accepted.</p>
<p>The license is at the root of the distribution, it&#8217;s called license.txt. It has some credit boilerplate language.</p>

Ah! Yes&#8230;I was looking all over the website and didn&#8217;t realize it was in the package.  Thank you so much for your prompt reply.</p>
