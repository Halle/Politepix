						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got my app(s) updated and submitted to Apple for approval (finger&#8217;s crossed) and I&#8217;m starting in on generating a couple of video how-to guides on the app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using the MAC OS software called AirServer to Airplay the screen from my iOS device to my MAC to record. The problem I&#8217;m running into is whenever I have an active Airplay connection and I turn the mic on (activate OpenEars), the AirPlay connection is dropped until I turn off the mic (tell OpenEars to stop listening).</p>
<p>Any ideas about what I can do to keep the Airplay connection active while using OpenEars?</p>
<p>Thanks Halle!<br />
Wes</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Ok, found a partial workaround from: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1803/_index.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1803/_index.html</a></p>
<p>Looks like iOS doesn&#8217;t let us do Airplay if we&#8217;re using the &#8220;VoiceChat&#8221; OpenEars option. Any of the other 4 options will allow Airplay, but then I lose the ability to play sounds from the app using the AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID method. Specifically, iOS disables Airplay when using the AudioSession property: AVAudioSessionModeVoiceChat</p>
<p>For now this will work for my demo video. The sound from the app isn&#8217;t necessary.</p>
<p>If you happen to know of a combination of settings the .audioMode property that allows for speech recognition + sound playback + Airplay, I&#8217;m all ears, so to speak. My guess is that I&#8217;d need to change how I&#8217;m playing sounds and move away from the AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID method.</p>
<p>Thanks Halle,<br />
Wes</p>

						<p>Hi Wes,</p>
<p>Sorry, I really don&#8217;t know the answer to that one â€“ the audio modes are offered on an as-is basis since trying to find all their quirks with different configurations would be prohibitive in terms of time, especially since they can also change in iOS releases.</p>

						<p>My standard piece of advice for doing repeated short sounds is always to put them in an AVAudioPlayer that has been prepared to play or played silently once, since it doesn&#8217;t raise the same compatibility issues as AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID (which compatibility issue is one of those quirks I mentioned).</p>

						<p>Thanks Halle,</p>
<p>I did a little experimenting, and AVAudioPlayer works on the local iPad device and when Airplaying to another source, however, AVAudioPlayer has a bit of a delay (maybe 0.2 seconds) in playing the audio even after calling prepareToPlay. Seems like that&#8217;s the nature of this mechanism.</p>
<p>In my case that wasn&#8217;t acceptable to convert over 100%, so I&#8217;ve gone back to using AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID which give a nice immediate sound effect when only on the iOS device (no airplay).</p>
<p>The workaround for anyone else reading is I look at the number of screens connected to the iOS device by calling [UIScreen screens]. If more than one (Airplay) then I configure PocketSphinx as the &#8220;Default&#8221; audioMode and use AVAudioPlayer to play my sounds. If there is only one screen then I configure PocketSphinx as the &#8220;VoiceChat&#8221; audioMode and use the AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID method to create and play sounds.</p>
<p>Not a perfect solution, but I figure that a little delay on the rarely used AirPlay mirroring is acceptable. 99% of the time the users would never run into this case and they get the optimal sound performance.</p>
