						<p>Sure, you can use it commercially for the purposes described in the license. </p>
<p>Powered by Politepix is nice and I would find that fine for my own credit if there was some kind of link so curious parties could find out what that meant. It would still be necessary to credit CMU so take a look at that part of the FAQ: <a href="/openears/support">/openears/support</a></p>

						<p>Ah, sorry, I over-edited the FAQ recently. OK, I can&#8217;t give you permission or advice for things relating to CMU because I am neither part of that program nor a lawyer. However, as another developer who uses their libraries I have the subjective impression that it is sufficient to credit each library and link to their agreement since the terms of their license are analogous to the MIT license. Something like this in your about appears to me as a good-faith attempt to meet CMU&#8217;s crediting request and mine:</p>
<p>$MYAPP uses CMU Sphinx, CMU Flite, CMU CLMTK [link here to the CMU agreement] and Politepix&#8217;s OpenEars [link here to politepix.com/openears].</p>

						<p>Here is an example of the CMU license:</p>
