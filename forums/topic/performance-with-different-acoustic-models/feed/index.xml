						<p>I was wondering if anyone has tried using different acoustic models from the default ones that come with OpenEars (which are trained on 8kHz sampled speech)?</p>
<p>If so, could you please describe which models you&#8217;ve used and let me know if you noticed any difference in the ASR performance. (this will obviously depend on the task/grammar, but even at the high-level I&#8217;m curious in other people experience with different acoustic models).</p>
<p>Two that come to mind are Voxforge (actually they seem to have couple of different acoustic models) and CMU Spinhx 16kHz HUB4 models from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/US%20English%20HUB4%20Acoustic%20Model/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/US%20English%20HUB4%20Acoustic%20Model/</a></p>
