						<p>I have just tried adding RapidEars to the sampleApp.  The app compiles but fails to run.</p>
<p>xCode fails on line 16 OpenEarsSampleApp/Supporting Files/main.m</p>

<p>I had to adapt the guide slightly this line is not right:</p>

<p>Instead I replaced it with </p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry you are having difficulty integrating the plugin. Please turn on logging and show the output so I can assist &#8212; the instructions are known to work so there must be a minor implementation issue which the OpenEars logging may assist with. Here is a link to how to turn logging on: <a href="/openears/yourapp/#logging">/openears/yourapp/#logging</a></p>
<p>Can you elaborate on what the difference is between your correction and the original instructions? They look like they are the same to me but maybe I am overlooking something.</p>
<p>Just checking since I recall you are using an earlier version of OpenEars, did you follow the instructions to update to OpenEars 1.1 before adding RapidEars?</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>No problem I assume it&#8217;s probably something simple I&#8217;ve missed at my end.</p>
<p>The log is here: <a href="https://pastebin.com/dcefjGdw" rel="nofollow">https://pastebin.com/dcefjGdw</a></p>
<p>I replaced<br />
[self.pocketsphinxController startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:self.pathToGrammarToStartAppWith dictionaryAtPath:self.pathToDictionaryToStartAppWith languageModelIsJSGF:FALSE];</p>
<p>With the following:<br />
[self.pocketsphinxController startRealtimeListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:self.pathToGrammarToStartAppWith andDictionaryAtPath:self.pathToDictionaryToStartAppWith];</p>
<p>I downloaded a new version of OpenEars from <a href="/openears/">/openears/</a> so I assume that is compatible and avoids the issue of upgrading.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>Based on the log, the plugin isn&#8217;t being used at all in the project since the error is that a method that is in the plugin isn&#8217;t available to the project. Can you elaborate on your comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 had to adapt the guide slightly this line is not right:</p>
<p>“Then replace all of the other occurences of startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath: with startRealtimeListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:”</p>
<p>Instead I replaced it with</p>
<p>[self.pocketsphinxController startRealtimeListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:self.pathToGrammarToStartAppWith andDictionaryAtPath:self.pathToDictionaryToStartAppWith]; // Starts the rapid recognition loop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the instructions say to replace all of the references to startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath: with startRealtimeListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:, which appears to be what you did? I&#8217;m still confused about what part of the instructions you are saying wasn&#8217;t right and I think maybe this could be related to the issue you&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>My impression is that the plugin isn&#8217;t added to the project target, or it isn&#8217;t being imported into the class in which you are using it by following these lines from the instructions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Open up ViewController.m in the editor and up at the top where the header imports are, after the line:</p>
<p>#import &lt;OpenEars/PocketsphinxController.h&gt;<br />
add the following lines:</p>
<p>#import &lt;RapidEarsDemo/PocketsphinxController+RapidEars.h&gt;<br />
#import &lt;RapidEarsDemo/OpenEarsEventsObserver+RapidEars.h&gt;
</p></blockquote>

						<p>Those lines are included, here&#8217;s a screenshot that shows them and the RapidEarsDemo.framework included.<br />

<p>What I mean is it doesn&#8217;t mention changing following part of the method call.</p>
<p>dictionaryAtPath:self.pathToDictionaryToStartAppWith languageModelIsJSGF:FALSE </p>
<p>to </p>

						<p>OK, that line is just intended to refer to changing all of the incidents of the old-style recognition start to the new-style recognition start (since it occurs many times in the sample app) in the same way as the example that comes right before it, but if it&#8217;s unclear as-is I can revise it to be clearer, thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>All righty, I&#8217;m not sure what the issue is with the project so could you put up your modified sample app somewhere for me to download and take a look at? You can remove the OpenEars framework from the sample app folder to save file size if you want (but don&#8217;t remove the RapidEars plugin since I need to see how that is connected to the project). Thanks!</p>

						<p>I think for clarity I would prefer it, at first I thought I was doing something wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve zipped everything up, both frameworks are included by reference though so I&#8217;m not sure if this will have everything you need.</p>

<p>OK, good to know that should be improved. I will need to take a look at your project in-depth a little later when I can reattach the references, but the only thing I noticed right off the bat is that you&#8217;ve added the -ObjC flag correctly but only for release and not debug. I guess if you&#8217;re then running it in debug it will probably be sad :) . Is it possible this is the issue?</p>

						<p>Thank you, you are correct. I&#8217;ve just added the flag to debug as well, I was certain I put it for both.  The app is no longer sad :)</p>

						<p>Excellent :) . Give it a try on a device for the best recognition quality (the simulator recognition is not so great).</p>
