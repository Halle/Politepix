						<p>1.) Is &#8220;Deployment PostProcessing&#8221; same as Deployment -&gt; Copy Phase Strip in Xcode 4.5.1?</p>
<p>2.) If we are using just flite, it is safe to delete both hub4wsj_sc_8k and cmu07a.dic? I have verified this but I want to make sure that it is indeed the case?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&#8211;MB.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>1) I believe it should still be called Deployment Postprocessing. I would search for that phrase in the search field.</p>
<p>2) Correct, that is what it says in the FAQ as well.</p>

						<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had time to double-check, confirming the fact that the &#8220;Deployment Postprocessing&#8221; build setting hasn&#8217;t had a change of name in recent versions of Xcode.</p>
