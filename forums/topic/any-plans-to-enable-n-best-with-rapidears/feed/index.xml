						<p>Hello, n-best would be a perfect solution for many applications that require live recognition. Is it possible to support it and do you plan to add the feature?</p>

						<p>+1 on N-Best with RapidEars. I gave up on purchasing RapidEars because N-Best is such a crucial element for the quality of my live numbers recognition application. No N-Best is a deal breaker for me.<br />
Come on Halle, you can do it, mobiles devices are so powerful these days ;)</p>
