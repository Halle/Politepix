						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>OpenEars can read text, so you would need to decide how to convert a file format that isn&#8217;t plain text into plain text to be used by OpenEars, and then you would need to split it up into small enough chunks of text that it wouldn&#8217;t be prohibitively slow for the enduser to listen to. NeatSpeech has built-in queuing to deal with keeping large amounts of text speaking fluently, but even with NeatSpeech you aren&#8217;t going to want to give it a 5-page Word file&#8217;s worth of text at once.</p>
