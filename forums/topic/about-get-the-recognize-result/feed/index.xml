						<p>dear Halle<br />
i find that if i want to get the recognize result, i has two ways.one is that using real time &#8216;startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath&#8217;, and when it get a recognized word, it callsbacks.another is using &#8216;pathToTestFile&#8217; it will give a callback.<br />
My questiin is that, if i have a way to stop current realtime input and get the result that has been input.</p>

						<p>soory, I mean if I have a way that i can input custom audio buffer in it.instead of the api startListen.<br />
Now i think i find the way to achieve my target.use rapidEars to have realtime recognize.but i find that rapidEars has crash when use it for server seconds, and it seems having memory leak, it always lead to a large memory useage increased every time to 100M and more</p>

						<p>OK, please read the note about using N-Best with RapidEars in its documentation – it&#8217;s explained that it&#8217;s an experimental feature and the developer has the job of keeping the overhead low enough for it to function. It is more likely that it has too much to do than that there is a leak.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>It is very easy to use multiple language models and switch between them with OpenEars. Please take a look at the OpenEars sample app, which has an example of dynamically generating a second language model and switching between models. It would probably also be useful for you to use the tutorial (<a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a>) and read the documentation for OpenEars to get an easy overview of the API.</p>
