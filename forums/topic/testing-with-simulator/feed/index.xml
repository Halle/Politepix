I do not have an apple app account just yet and wanted to test the app locally to make sure I am doing things correctly. Thanks for any thoughts.</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t test out recognition quality, sorry. It will run on the simulator, but the quality of recognition will be significantly worse than on a device, so it can&#8217;t be used for information about accuracy.</p>

						<p>Ok, but it should acknowledge &#8220;something&#8221;&#8230;ok, that should be good enough for my unit testing. Thanks, that helps.</p>
