						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a feature of FliteController, but it could be added to stock OpenEars pretty easily by adding a new method to pause/unpause FliteController&#8217;s AVAudioPlayer if it is playing. In NeatSpeech your option is to send a request to stop, but this will stop at the earliest opportunity to finish an utterance rather than pausing immediately.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle!</p>
<p>It seemed more appropriate to reply here than start a new thread. I have a need to Pause and Resume NeatSpeech output. It looks like I can pause AVAudioPlayer&#8217;s output, but I&#8217;d really like to be able to do this on a word (or even better, sentence) boundary.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see this capability in the Class reference. Did I miss it? If it isn&#8217;t there, is it something you&#8217;ve considered adding? AVSpeechSynthesizer lets me do it, but your voices sound better&#8230; :- )</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>Hi Claude,</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s a very nice compliment :) . The thought has definitely crossed my mind and I appreciate the feedback on expanding the NeatSpeech API. In the short term there is a lot of other stuff on my plate, but once everything that is pre-shipping and in-progress has shipped, I plan to take another look at the NeatSpeech interface and see how challenging those developments would be.</p>
