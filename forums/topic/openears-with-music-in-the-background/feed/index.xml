						<p>Hi, has anybody tried using OpenEars in a noisy environment with lots of music or speech? I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any way to train it to detect the subtleties of my voice over others? :)</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Sorry, it isn&#8217;t possible to train OpenEars&#8217;s PocketsphinxController speech recognition class to a particular voice purely through the use of OpenEars (if you can also use a server, the acoustic models can be adapted using these instructions: <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt" rel="nofollow">http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt</a>). In a noisy environment filtering out background noise might have to be accomplished via headset mic, mic directionality, or a distinct volume level difference between the spoken instruction and the background noise, or non-keywords might be possible to filter out after speech including noise has been captured by use of the Rejecto plugin (although this is tricky even with the use of Rejecto).</p>

						<p>Thanks Halle. I just gave it a try in my car. Unfortunately the music didn&#8217;t have to be very loud for it to stop working. A shame.. Howevever, I did suspect this would be the case months before even looking for voice recognition. My car used to have a voice recognition system built into it (in Japanese) &#8211; shame I couldn&#8217;t use that mic with my iPod.. but that wouldn&#8217;t suit everyone. :-)</p>
<p>I did find OpenEars very easy to use though &#8211; excellent job.</p>
