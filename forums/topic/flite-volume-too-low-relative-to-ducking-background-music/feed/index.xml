						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing text to speech (using flitecontroller say) while ducking music in the background.  I got this working but the speech volume is too low relative to the music. So to hear the voice, the music needs to be uncomfortably loud. Is there any way to increase the flite speech volume?  </p>
<p>I tried increasing rateconvo.c filt-&gt;gain from 0.8 to 1.0 (and also to 10.0) but that had no noticeable effect.  I also tried modifying flitecontroller audioplayer volume, but the default  is already 1.0 (the max).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Generally if the speech is very quiet, there is an issue with the audio session, possible the route or session type. I&#8217;d check out your modifications to AudioSessionManager that allow ducking and background music playing, since those are in the part of the code that relates to the issue.</p>
