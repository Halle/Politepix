						<p>I apologize if my question is too general for this forum, however I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot.</p>
<p>Politepix managed to create an intelligence that detects and recognizes speech to text. Meaning it is able to input words to its system.</p>
<p>Also it is known that Siri nowadays supports Asian languages such as Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean</p>
<p>Words are just a bunch sounds&#8230; I am wondering, then, if there is an intelligence that detects specific sounds that are not &#8220;words&#8221; (ex. clap sound, whistle sound, breathing sound).</p>
<p>So far all I found are frameworks or SDK&#8217;s that are based on decibel sensitivity.</p>
<p>Truly Appreciate any feedback or reference. </p>

<p>Sorry, I&#8217;m not aware of any frameworks which do that.</p>
