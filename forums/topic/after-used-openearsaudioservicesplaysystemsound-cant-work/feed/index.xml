						<p>OpenEars is great, but I found, if  I used pocketsphinxController to recognize voice, after that, AudioServicesPlaySystemSound() can&#8217;t make any sound&#8230;.<br />
Can OpenEars  work with AudioToolbox.framework?<br />
Anyone  figure out that?</p>

						<p>OpenEars uses the AudioToolbox.framework so it has to be compatible with it. Can you tell me which version of OpenEars you are using? This might have something to do with the new AudioSessionManager behavior in 1.0/1.01.</p>

						<p>Oh, oh, on March 19, the same problem is happening.  I downloaded and re-installed the &#8220;OpenEars Stable&#8221; just to make sure I was up with the very latest release.  Haven&#8217;t tried 1.3 since it&#8217;s going into a to-be-produced product.<br />
Thanks.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are some known iOS issues with system sounds and the PlayAndRecord audio session setting &#8212; I think this thread has a bit more information:</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/keep-system-sounds-while-listening/">/forums/topic/keep-system-sounds-while-listening/</a></p>
<p>And all of the discussions to date can be read here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=site%3A%2Fforums+AudioServicesPlaySystemSound" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=site%3A%2Fforums+AudioServicesPlaySystemSound</a></p>
<p>The bottom line is that you can always play back with AVAudioPlayer, but you could encounter difficulties using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound, although it might be worth trying the workarounds in the linked threads.</p>
