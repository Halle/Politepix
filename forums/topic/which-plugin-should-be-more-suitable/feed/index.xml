						<p>Hello, I&#8217;m new to openears….<br />
What I need is to take input from user (only one word should be detected), and compared to my data….<br />
It&#8217;s like a quiz where the person should say the word on the screen…<br />
Also, I need a better tutorial for the demos of the rejecto and ruleorama plugin, it really isn&#8217;t working for me….<br />
Thanks a million! </p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<blockquote><p>Which Plugin should be more suitable?</p></blockquote>
<p>You should start with the stock OpenEars distribution and get the basics of your app requirements working, and at that point you should be able to see if you have any further requirements that are more specific and whether you need to use one of the plugins.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, I need a better tutorial for the demos of the rejecto and ruleorama plugin, it really isn’t working for me….</p></blockquote>
<p>The tutorial is known to work, and there is also lots of additional information in the documentation and then also in these forums, so I think there should be enough info across the spectrum of simplicity to in-depth info to get started with the plugins. If you are having any specific issues, you can describe them here and I can try to assist you.</p>
