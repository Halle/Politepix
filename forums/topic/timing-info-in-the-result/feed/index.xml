						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Do you have plans to include the timing info in the recognition results (e.g. start/end times at the word, or even phoneme level)</p>

						<p>Pocketsphinx has api to get start/end frame, acoustic score and language score for each word: ps_seg_frames, ps_seg_prob.<br />
This two api return timing information as well as score for each word.<br />
Is there anyway to get this api work in OpenEars?</p>

						<p>Certainly, you can make any modifications to the Pocketsphinx code you like and recompile the framework. OpenEars doesn&#8217;t interfere with that, it just doesn&#8217;t return this data along with hypotheses through its own API.</p>
