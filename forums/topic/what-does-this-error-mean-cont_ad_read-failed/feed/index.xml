						<p>Welcome,</p>
<blockquote><p>is there a proper way to destroy the pocketsphinxController?</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this happen after leaving a view controller and then recreating it? It&#8217;s necessary to call [self.pocketsphinxController stopListening] before doing anything that ought to result in the pocketsphinxController being released.</p>
<p>If that isn&#8217;t the issue I&#8217;d need a bit more information about the structure of your app, any other audio-using operations that are also occurring in the same app, and the complete OpenEarsLogging output (the beginning has been omitted above).</p>

						<p>Thanks Halle! That was precisely it.  In some cases I was calling stopListening but in others I wasn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
