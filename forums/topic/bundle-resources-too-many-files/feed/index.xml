						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Our universal app is about to use NeatSpeech 1.01, RapidEars 1.1, and OpenEars 1.2.5.  I&#8217;ve used the demos and just plain OpenEars before deciding on this config.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if we need all these files in Bundle Resources.  With all the fooling around I&#8217;ve been doing, maybe there are some unnecessary ones.  It may be obvious that some like the README file can be deleted, but I don&#8217;t want to take any chances without asking you.  Thanks so much for your help.  You&#8217;ve been very helpful so far, either directly, or reading this forum.</p>
<p>in Framework/hub4wsj_sc_8k: feat.params, mdef, means, noisedict, sendump, transition_matrices, &amp; variances</p>
<p>In Framework (this looks like it should all be preserved): OpenEars1.dic, OpenEars1.gram, OpenEars1.languagemodel.  OpenEars2.gram. OpenEarsCorpus.txt</p>
<p>in Voices/VoiceData/NeatSpeechUSDataset1: All PDF and INF files, &#8230;COPYING, &#8230;INSTALL, neatspeech_us1_lf0.win[1-3], neatspeech_us1_lpf.win1, neatspeech_us1_mgc.win[1-3], neatspeech_us1_README</p>
<p>Once again, thanks, and I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;m not the one that disproves the saying that there are no stupid questions.</p>
<p>Have a good day,<br />
Larry</p>

						<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>Good question. All the ones you listed are required except for this set, which can be removed if you have generated your own language models:</p>
<blockquote><p>OpenEars1.dic, OpenEars1.gram, OpenEars1.languagemodel.  OpenEars2.gram. OpenEarsCorpus.txt</p></blockquote>
<p>You can also remove COPYING, INSTALL and neatspeech_us1_README without affecting the app behavior, but I wouldn&#8217;t, since they contain important licensing information and are very small in size, and the user will never see the items inside the bundle.</p>
