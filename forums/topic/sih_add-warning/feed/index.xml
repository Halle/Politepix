						<![CDATA[
						<p>I keep getting the following warning in my app after implementing openears:<br />
sih_add WARNING: repeated hashing of &#8216;DOWN&#8217;, older value will be overridden.</p>
<p>It occurs numerous times while using my app and i have no idea what this warning is. I have searched and found nothing about it. Does anyone have any idea why this warning occurs?</p>
<p>My app does appear to work correctly even with this warning, im just intrigued as to why it is appearing.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, this can happen when the same word is entered in the dictionary twice.</p>

						<p>But it is happening when running LanguageModelGenerator, correct?</p>
<p>Careful, I&#8217;m not sure you can have just a single word in your vocabulary without crashing.</p>

						<p>Yes that is correct and the LanguageModelGenerator is run in the viewDidLoad method.</p>
<p>Sorry what i wrote was a little confusing, i have multiple entries in my vocabulary but only one entry with the word &#8220;Down&#8221;</p>

						<p>Ah, OK. FWIW, I think the warning is not actually reporting a problem, it&#8217;s more of an informative warning. Do you have verboseLanguageModelGenerator on?</p>
