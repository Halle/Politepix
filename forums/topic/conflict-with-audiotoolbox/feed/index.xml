						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come across a few posts before that mention some issues with AudioToolBox, playing system sounds and OpenEars. They mention upgrading to 1.01, which i have done, however i&#8217;m still not able to play any system sounds or vibrate the phone. If i run the app without OpenEars it all works. I&#8217;m using iOS 5 and iPhone 4, any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Lloyd</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is the authoritative discussion on this, but my impression is that it&#8217;s a bug or questionable feature of the audio session: <a href="/forums/topic/keep-system-sounds-while-listening/">/forums/topic/keep-system-sounds-while-listening/</a></p>
<p>I unfortunately don&#8217;t have any insight into this issue beyond the thread discussion.</p>
<p>Say, would you be so kind as to remove the salty language in your language model when you post your logs? I don&#8217;t have a content filter on the forum because it&#8217;s almost never needed, but it&#8217;s better kept out of Google&#8217;s index for the site. Thank you!</p>
