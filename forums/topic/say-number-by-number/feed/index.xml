						<p>Sure, this is just an implementation detail for you since you are controlling the string that is passed to FliteController. Instead of passing FliteController the word &#8220;1200&#8221;, pass &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221; then &#8220;0&#8221; then &#8220;0&#8221;, or pass &#8220;one two zero zero&#8221;.</p>

						<p>Thanks for your reply, but what if I have the NSString as &#8220;11234, SunWood Dr.&#8221;<br />
If I pass this to FliteController , it would became one thousand one hundred thirty four.<br />
You  mean I have to convert to the string as &#8220;1 1 2 3 4 , SunWood Dr&#8217;?</p>

						<p>Correct, you need to create some method for parsing your text into the format that you need spoken. Flite doesn&#8217;t have a built-in system for detecting what kind of a number it is being given (this is a good thing since it would lead to wrong assumptions). Without knowing much about your requirements, something that is fairly simple might be to just try to detect the numbers 1-9 in your text string and replace them with the equivalent word (e.g. replace &#8220;1&#8221; with &#8220;one&#8221;, etc). But if you don&#8217;t know much about the text that is coming in, or you know that a &#8220;1&#8221; could mean more than one thing if it occurs in your text, this approach might be too primitive.</p>
