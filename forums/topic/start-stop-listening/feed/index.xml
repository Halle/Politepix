						<p>OK, I don&#8217;t actually support simulator-only issues, not because I don&#8217;t care at all but because the simulator just hosts the local audio devices of the desktop or laptop, meaning that any individual simulator-only issue can potentially be due to just one particular arrangement of hardware that is on the local machine, meaning that any fix might only fix something that is special to one desktop or laptop version or audio conversion device. </p>
<p>Since the end-user of the app will never encounter the issue, I made the judgement call that it would be better to ignore simulator-only issues than to put heavy debugging time into issues that don&#8217;t affect app users. I hope that&#8217;s understandable and that you&#8217;ll let me know if you see issues with enduser devices.</p>
