						<p>Hey,</p>
<p>First of all I would like to thank you for this awesome library! </p>
<p>I would like to add some graphic representation of the user voice (just like siri on ios 7).. I found some examples that can help me draw the wave form, my problem is how can I access the microphone data (I haven&#8217;t found any delegate method that can pass the voice data so I can parse it into a wave form)</p>
<p>am I missing something? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance and keep up the good work :)</p>
<p>Guy.  </p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Sure, just check out the sample app which ships with the main distribution in order to see examples of OpenEars level reading methods with comments on their use.</p>
