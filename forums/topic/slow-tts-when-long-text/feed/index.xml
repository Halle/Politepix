						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I&#8217;v playing with OpenEars for few days now and i really like it :)</p>
<p>One issue though (i dont know if it&#8217;s OpenEars specific): when i try to TTS large text (say from an article) it takes it a long time until it starts playing it.</p>
<p>Small text: 1.5 seconds</p>
<p>Large text: 74 seconds</p>
<p>The long wait is due to:</p>
<blockquote><p>cst_wave *speechwaveform = flite_text_to_wave(statementToSay,voice);</p></blockquote>
<p> in FliteController.h ,I added NSLog output of the time it takes this call to finish.</p>
<p>Is there any way of speeding this up?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Danny</p>

						<p>Welcome Danny,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to hear you&#8217;re enjoying OpenEars. The fact that all text is rendered at once and then played when it&#8217;s all ready is a limitation of FliteController, but NeatSpeech (a paid plugin for OpenEars here: <a href="/neatspeech">/neatspeech</a>) was created in order to speed up speech by streaming long speech in segments instead of first rendering everything and then playing, so you might want to give its demo a try and see if it helps with your requirements. </p>
