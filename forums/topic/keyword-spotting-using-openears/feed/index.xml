						<![CDATA[
						<p>I am trying to use OpenEars as an additional tool to Nuance that would help it with recognizing names from person&#8217;s contact list.</p>
<p>For example, I would send to Nuance &#8220;Call my friend Maxim&#8221; and usually it hears &#8220;mexican&#8221; instead. And I would have a separate OpenEars thread that would specifically listen to friend&#8217;s names only. And if this thread could catch &#8220;Maxim&#8221; in my phrase, that would be fantastically helpful to me!</p>
<p>Now, I have tried to create a custom dictionary made of friends&#8217; names and run OpenEars sample. And it recognized the whole phrase &#8220;Call my friend Maxim&#8221; into words of this custom dictionary. It has caught &#8216;Maxim&#8217; correctly, but also it has drew up other words to my friends&#8217; names.  Is it possible to have a separate recognitionScore for each recognized word in the input?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>OK, to clarify my own understanding of the issue, is what is happening that the actual phrase is &#8220;call my friend Maxim&#8221; and what is being reported is &#8220;Molly Glen Maxim&#8221; or something along those lines with the non-name words being replaced by similar-sounding names? Or is the issue that the rest of the sentence is being recognized correctly but you want to disregard non-name words which are in your language model?</p>
<p>The end goal is just to be informed that &#8220;Maxim&#8221; was detected in the sentence without needing to know the specifics about the other words, is that correct?  I don&#8217;t think there is a way to get per-word scores for a multiple word sentence, but n-best scoring will be coming up in the next version of OpenEars.</p>

						<p>&#8220;the actual phrase is “call my friend Maxim” and what is being reported is “Molly Glen Maxim” or something along those lines with the non-name words being replaced by similar-sounding names?&#8221; yes, exactly.<br />
Similarly, if I say &#8216;Call restaurant&#8217; it would recognize &#8216;Molly Cris Ann&#8217;<br />
I am looking for a way to know that &#8216;Maxim&#8217; In the first case was recognized with a higher probability</p>

						<p>OK, I think that the upcoming n-best feature should handle this for you but there isn&#8217;t anything in the current version which I can think of which will help. I&#8217;m hoping to release the next version around next Monday.</p>

						<p>Halle, next Monday would be great! Looking forward to try out the idea. Please let me know if I can get the next cersionearlier to play with it, even if it&#8217;s still buggy</p>

						<p>Hi Maria,</p>
<p>The new version is up (I haven&#8217;t had time to update the detailed documentation so I haven&#8217;t announced it yet but you can see it at <a href="/openears">/openears</a>) so you can give it a try. There is a preprocessor define that turns on n-best in the new sample app so you can uncomment it to experiment with n-best and scoring.</p>

<p>Take a look at the sample app and search for &#8220;nbest&#8221;.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Thanks, I figured it out and ran the sample. Yeah, n-best is not exactly what I need (I need rather per-word score), but will try to play with it and see. </p>
<p>Another question: how big the grammar can be? I have a vocabulary of around 2000 words, is it OK?</p>

						<p>Sounds a little big for local recognition (I think 500-1000 words is probably better) but the only way to know for sure is to test.</p>
<p>Try setting n-best to return the 1 best hyp with a score and I think you should receive the score per word.</p>
