						<p>Hi :)<br />
I am still playing with the sample app as far as voice recognition is concerned.<br />
I added a phrase to the dynamic generated dictionary:<br />
@&#8221;FIND PART NUMBER&#8221;<br />
and added all numbers from zero to nine.</p>
<p>Now the phone can recognise things like:<br />
&#8220;One Part Number&#8221;<br />
I thought defining a phrase is supposed to isolate it,<br />
otherwise why not just separate the words?<br />
Cheers, Art.</p>

						<p>I read the comment in the source more carefully, and it says:<br />
&#8220;This increases the probability that they will be recognized as a phrase&#8221;<br />
It would be good to increase the probability to 100%, as in recognise it as a phrase,<br />
or none of the separate words at all ;)</p>
<p>Relating to another thread,<br />
I agree with another member that the multithreading flite is good :)</p>

						<p>Hi, </p>
<p>ARPA is probabilistic and increasing the probability of a phrase to 100% would break it as designed. What you are looking for is JSGF, which is a rules-based grammar. If you search for JSGF on this forum you should get a lot of starting info to research it further.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>In addition to the dynamic grammar generation that has been added to stock OpenEars in version 1.7, there is also a new plugin called RuleORama which can use the same API in order to generate grammars which are a bit faster and compatible with RapidEars: <a href="/ruleorama">/ruleorama</a></p>
