		<p>I have seen some posts about this in the forums, but couldn&#8217;t find an answer.</p>
<ul>The goal:</ul>
<p>After the user says a phrase, I want OpenEars to stop listening.</p>
<ul>The problem:</ul>
<p>When calling stopListening from pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis, stopListening will take a long time to return.  If I turn logging on, I will see the following error reported numerous times:<br>
<em>Unable to stop listening because because an utterance is still in progress; trying again.</em><br>
Note: this works fine when I use a device with iOS8 but fails on multiple devices<br>
using iOS9</p>
<p>In order to rule out other things my app is doing, I modified the sample app and can reproduce the problem.<br>
The only thing I changed, was to make it use a grammar instead of a language:</p>
<pre><code>NSDictionary *firstGrammar = @{OneOfTheseWillBeSaidOnce:@[
                                                                @&quot;MY LIBRARY&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;SETTINGS&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;HELP&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;LANGUAGE&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;SAVE&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;NEW DOCUMENT&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;LIST COMMANDS&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;STOP&quot;,
                                                                @&quot;CHANGE MODEL&quot;]};</code></pre>
<p>And in pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis call stopListening if the STOP command was called.</p>

Now using the fallback method to look it up. If this is happening more frequently than you would expect, likely causes can be that you are entering words in another language from the one you are recognizing, or that there are symbols (including numbers) that need to be spelled out or cleaned up, or you are using your own acoustic model and there is an issue with either its phonetic dictionary or it lacks a g2p file.

#pragma mark OEEventsObserver delegate methods

// What follows are all of the delegate methods you can optionally use once you&#039;ve instantiated an OEEventsObserver and set its delegate to self. 
// I&#039;ve provided some pretty granular information about the exact phase of the Pocketsphinx listening loop, the Audio Session, and Flite, but I&#039;d expect 
// that the ones that will really be needed by most projects are the following:
//
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidBegin;
//- (void) audioSessionInterruptionDidEnd;
//- (void) audioRouteDidChangeToRoute:(NSString *)newRoute;
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidStartListening;
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidStopListening;
//
// It isn&#039;t necessary to have a OEPocketsphinxController or a OEFliteController instantiated in order to use these methods.  If there isn&#039;t anything instantiated that will
// send messages to an OEEventsObserver, all that will happen is that these methods will never fire.  You also do not have to create a OEEventsObserver in
// the same class or view controller in which you are doing things with a OEPocketsphinxController or OEFliteController; you can receive updates from those objects in
// any class in which you instantiate an OEEventsObserver and set its delegate to self.

		<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know you are also experiencing this – it is a high priority to fix but I haven&#8217;t had the same success reproducing it. I am currently trying to reproduce this from a submitted recording (I haven&#8217;t been able to reliably reproduce it with a local recording which is a prerequisite for adding a test to prevent this generally). Is there any chance you could take a look at this post about replication cases with audio recordings and consider making me a recording to go with your sample app that reliably causes this when run with pathToTestFile?</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/">https://www.politepix.com/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/</a></p>
<p>Note that this requires a) installing the SaveThatWave demo, b) getting a complete audio dump of the session in which this happens, c) adding the audio file to your sample app code above by using pathToTestFile, and d) making sure that the issue replicates when you run the app, so we&#8217;ll know it will replicate for me as well. If possible, this would be extremely helpful towards fixing this issue faster.</p>

2016-05-05 21:01:01.096 OpenEarsSampleApp[733:193018] The word TAH was not found in the dictionary of the acoustic model /var/containers/Bundle/Application/1AC0B9E8-E6D7-4923-AF38-99FBE0E560A1/OpenEarsSampleApp.app/AcousticModelEnglish.bundle. Now using the fallback method to look it up. If this is happening more frequently than you would expect, likely causes can be that you are entering words in another language from the one you are recognizing, or that there are symbols (including numbers) that need to be spelled out or cleaned up, or you are using your own acoustic model and there is an issue with either its phonetic dictionary or it lacks a g2p file. Please get in touch at the forums for assistance with the last two possible issues.

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for taking the time. I ran your file and view controller code (on an iPhone 5S with 9.3.1) and the issue didn&#8217;t replicate for me yet – with which device do you reliably experience this result? Is there anything interesting about the device that could lead to it being more prone towards this result (hard to imagine, but maybe something like having lots of apps loaded, conceivably an audio app backgrounded, very little disk space available, jailbroken, anything of note)? </p>
<p>The logs are intriguing because it actually doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s an utterance in progress at the time that it complains that there is. In the other report of this issue there is a slow search happening while stopping is being attempted, but in this one the hypothesis is received and it doesn&#8217;t even look like listening is resumed before the shutdown starts. I&#8217;m suspicious of that route change, which looks kind of extraneous and which also pops up in the other report right before the bad shutdown.</p>

		<p>Halle,</p>
<p>Phone info:<br>
Model: A1688 iPhone 6s<br>
iOS: 9.3.1<br>
Storage: 128GB (55GB free space)</p>
<p>Nothing special about the phone, not jail broken, it has a fair amount of apps, but plenty of free space.<br>
I also tried a fresh reboot of the phone and reran the sample app and still had the bug.</p>
<p>A colleague is also experiencing the problem.  (I believe he has an iPhone 6+ with 9.3.1)</p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to run any more tests or need more information about my device.</p>
<p>thanks<br>
-steve</p>

		<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Just an update that I am now seeing this replicate on a 6S with 9.3.1 and I&#8217;m investigating the cause. Thank you for the test case.</p>

		<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This actually looks like a different issue due to a conflicting audio session being used at the same time (there&#8217;s a session error during the shutdown process if you look up above). But the initial issue is replicated so there should be a fix for it shortly.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Unfortunately audio session coexistence isn&#8217;t supported, so even if the error being returned is a new thing due to the OS version, I can&#8217;t necessarily help with it. But the hang might be fixed incidentally by testing against the first case now that I can replicate it (let&#8217;s hope so).</p>

		<p>Yeah sure.. another observation is.. Does this problem exist ONLY on arm64 architecture based devices.. I couldn&#8217;t try testing on an iOS 8.X with arm64 device to confirm my doubt.. all of my devices are iOS 9.x with arm64.. Hope that helps in your debugging.</p>

		<p>OK, this issue is fixed for the upcoming version (it is a race condition between the shutdown process and a new utterance starting that only manifests on very fast devices), no more info needed here. No estimated delivery date for the next version, but it is only dependent on one more bug fix and testing time, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too long.</p>

		<p>Hi,  I too was noticing the 10 second delay in my App but after your latest update that issue is resolved.  However now I am noticing some other strange issues, and was wondering if you could check to see if your 2.504 version experiences anything like it.  Keep in mind that I haven&#8217;t touched this application in a while, until the error with the 10 second delay, so these issues could be related to new iOS releases and not OpenEars.</p>
<p>1.) My application uses background audio which allows it to play when minimized or screen dimmed.  Now, if I minimize my application and try to play video or audio from a different application, it used to stop my App audio playback and switch over to their application.  Now certain applications, like playing a regular recorded Video inside of the default Photos application on iPhone will not work at all.  The play button does not function.  Curiously, the only way for me to get the Photos application working again is to launch Pandora, which seems to wake up the audio/video processes again. If I then go back to my OpenEars enabled app, play audio, and minimize, the same playback issue is replicated.   Could certainly be a problem with how I am handling background services, but I thought I&#8217;d ask and see if you are noticing anything similar in your latest version.  </p>
<p>2.) My Apps audio playback will be silent after stopListen unless I pause, clear queue, add audio, then pause it again, then try audio playback again.  It&#8217;s very strange.. I wrote this code a long time ago, and it&#8217;s messy, so it could easily be a bug in my logic which I am looking into.  This is probably my problem, not yours, but I thought I&#8217;d mention it just in case.</p>
<p>My Application is a choose your own adventure audio book.  So it plays an mp3, waits for you to respond with a voice command, and then plays the next section.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry, there have been no recent changes that would lead to these issues. They are situations where minor iOS or device changes can bring out new behavior so I would check against other iOS versions and file a radar if the behavior is undesirable, or spend more simplifying the messy code so a clear correlation emerges that would be possible to replicate and troubleshoot. I don&#8217;t actually support background mode so I wouldn&#8217;t be able to help much with that aspect generally, sorry.</p>
<p>I will close this since it is pretty far afield of the topic, but if you have issues happening in the foreground that you can create a reduced and simple example of an issue which is demonstrably related to OpenEars according to this process:</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/">https://www.politepix.com/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/</a></p>
<p>then it&#8217;s totally fine to open a new topic just for that report and I&#8217;ll be happy to take a look, thanks.</p>
