						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am building an app for the new iPhones but the framework doesn&#8217;t seem to support the 64 bit architectures (x86_64 for the simulator and amd64 for the device).</p>
<p>Is this available?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Todd</p>

						<p>Welcome Todd,</p>
<p>Yes, I am working away on this as we speak and hope it&#8217;s only a matter of weeks. The conversion is a big job and the whole platform has to be released simultaneously which is why it is taking a bit of time.</p>

						<p>For now you can just open up your app build settings and remove the 64-bit architecture from the ARCHITECTURES setting. This will work fine on the 64-bit devices and have no effect on the others.</p>
