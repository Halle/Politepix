						<p>Welcome Ravi,</p>
<p>This can happen if you didn&#8217;t add the -ObjC other linker flag or if the voices weren&#8217;t added to your target when you imported the voices folder, usually due to something going wrong with this step:</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to use NeatSpeech, as well as importing the framework into your OpenEars-enabled project, it is also necessary to import the voices and voice data files by dragging the &#8220;Voice&#8221; folder in the disk image into your app project. Make sure that in Xcode&#8217;s &#8220;Add&#8221; dialog, &#8220;Create groups for any added folders&#8221; is selected. Make sure that &#8220;Create folder references for any added folders&#8221; is not selected or your app will not work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also make sure that your app target is checked in that &#8220;Add file&#8221; dialog so the items which are being added are also being added to your target.</p>
<p>The error just means that the code for the NeatSpeechVoice &#8220;Emma&#8221; is not available to your project.</p>
