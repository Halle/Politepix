						<p>Hi, Im interested in using the OpenEars library for my project and I want to ask you some questions</p>
<p>Does the software convert any speech I can make into voice? If I say &#8220;Pao&#8221;, would it output &#8216;Pao&#8217;? What about &#8220;BLAHBLAHBLAH&#8221;, would it output that? Or is it just limited to dictionary words?</p>
<p>If I say a number, lets say five, does it output &#8216;5&#8217; or &#8216;five?</p>
<p>How long do I make a pause till I get the output? </p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>OpenEars can recognize words from a vocabulary that you set. If you make a vocabulary with &#8220;Pao&#8221; it can recognize &#8220;Pao&#8221;, but you might have to make an entry in its lookup dictionary for how that should be pronounced. &#8220;5&#8221; versus &#8220;five&#8221; is the same &#8212; you add the one to your dictionary that you want returned. You can adjust the pause but it defaults to .7 seconds which I think is the best timeframe for most applications.</p>

						<p>Is there a way to recognize anything? I had an app that makes people fill out forms that contains first name, last name, address, etc and a speech recognition is nice to have compared to typing a keyboard</p>

						<p>Nope, it (and all speech recognition) always works from a predefined vocabulary list. If you can get text of their name, you can add the name to the list, but that might not help you since presumably you want them to make their very first name entry via speech, correct? So without knowing their name in advance, you can&#8217;t recognize their name.</p>

						<p>Hi, I followed the quick start tutorial just today and so far its working. One thing I don&#8217;t like is to predefining the vocabularies such that it accepts all possible words spoken. Is there a way to at least get the vocabulary lists on the device instead of typing all possible words?</p>
<p>For the numbers, I&#8217;ve added &#8216;1&#8217; along with &#8216;WORD&#8217; &amp; &#8216;STATEMENT&#8217; and when I said &#8216;1&#8217;, it returns &#8216;WORD&#8217;. why is that? Also, when &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;ONE&#8217; is added, &#8216;ONE&#8217; always returns; Does it mean that its more likely to return words instead of numbers?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t quite understand this question &#8212; can you clarify what you are wanting to do here a bit more?</p>
<blockquote><p>For the numbers, I’ve added ’1′ along with ‘WORD’ &#038; ‘STATEMENT’ and when I said ’1′, it returns ‘WORD’. why is that? Also, when ’1′ and ‘ONE’ is added, ‘ONE’ always returns; Does it mean that its more likely to return words instead of numbers?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is probably because &#8220;ONE&#8221; is finding a more accurate pronunciation match in the dictionary for your accent. If &#8220;1&#8221; is giving undesired results and &#8220;ONE&#8221; isn&#8217;t, go with &#8220;ONE&#8221;. It&#8217;s always necessary to do a bit of refinement on a vocabulary for best results.</p>

<p>Nevermind, I&#8217;ll figure it out on my own.</p>
<p>I just found a critical problem. Let say I made a view controller to be presented and it contains a button to toggle whether to turn on or off OpenEars. When turned on, it calls the [pocketspinxController startListening] and when turned off, it calls the [pocketspinxController stopListening]. However when I turned it on again,either on same view or when the view is dismissed and presented again, it either crash or just froze on [pocket startListening]. Any Ideas why?</p>

						<p>You can only have one listening loop running at once. If you have one running, you have to stop it before starting a new one.</p>
