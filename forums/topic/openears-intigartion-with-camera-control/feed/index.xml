						<p>Hello,<br />
I have made a demo of voice recognition with openEars and its working fine. But now i want to integrate it with camera control. For example when user shout START camera will start video recording and stop video recording with STOP.<br />
My first question is it possible with OpenEars??<br />
And if yes can you help me to get start.<br />
Do any one know any such application??</p>

						<p>Okay.<br />
So i try to get it work with UIImagePickerController, but when UIImagePickerController comes in play </p>

						<p>What is the relationship between the picker code and the code above? Probably it&#8217;s not the case that startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath: doesn&#8217;t trigger but rather that it gets to a certain point in the loop and has trouble. If you turn on verbosePocketSphinx and OpenEarsLogging the output will probably tell you a lot about the reason that startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath: isn&#8217;t getting good results. You can search the log output for the words &#8220;error&#8221; or &#8220;warning&#8221; specifically or you can post it here (but please make sure both forms of logging have been turned on first so I can really see everything that is happening).</p>

						<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that logging has verbosePocketSphinx enabled. If it does, that means that your app has an issue that is blocking before [self.pocketsphinxController startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:lmPath dictionaryAtPath:dicPath languageModelIsJSGF:NO];, not during it, since the logging would show it starting but stopping somewhere, but this logging shows nothing that happens after the language model is generated.  I recommended showing the relationship between your picker code and the OpenEars code before &#8212; without that or the output with verbosePocketsphinx there&#8217;s no way to know what is happening since the code above is the code which works in the sample app.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I m really sorry for my explanation its really bad.</p>
<p>So i have create a viewController and put all the method of OpenEars in viewDidload and add this controller as camera overlay.</p>
<p>Pardon me but i don&#8217;t understand your point by &#8220;I donâ€™t think that logging has verbosePocketSphinx enabled&#8221;, can you explain it more so i can help my self by giving you more info.</p>

						<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>No problem, just go to <a href="/openears">/openears</a> and search the page for &#8220;verbosePocketSphinx&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see the property definition. There is also an example of using it in the sample app view controller if you search for that string.</p>
