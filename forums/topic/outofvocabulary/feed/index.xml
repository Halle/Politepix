						<p>Dear Halle,</p>
<p>I want to get the hypothesis only if the spoken word is &#8220;probably&#8221; within my vocabulary. Is there any way to neglect low confidence hypotheses or map them to a predefined value?</p>
<p>In other words, I do not want Pocketsphinx to map OOV words to wrong hypotheses.</p>
<p>Note: Only a single word may be OOV within a sentence. I do not want to ignore the whole sentence in that case.</p>
<p>Btw, I do not have any progress about my last question due to lots of other works I am working on, I will share here when I have any progress.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

						<p>Hi akaniklaus,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to recommend that you bring your Pocketsphinx functionality questions to the Pocketsphinx support board since they are the originators and maintainers of the code you have questions about. You&#8217;re always welcome to ask me questions about accessing Pocketsphinx functions you are already making use of in C or on the command line via Objective-C, but unfortunately I can&#8217;t offer general &#8220;how do I handle research task x with Pocketsphinx&#8221; support here since it is such a broad subject and one with its own support system.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Halle</p>

						<p>Hi akaniklaus,<br />
do you managed to get lucky with the words out vocabulary? I&#8217;m looking in the Pocketsphinx forum , hoping to find a general method robust enough, but for now I have not found anything more than what I have done alone.</p>

						<p>Updated: you can now handle out of vocabulary rejection using Politepix&#8217;s <a href="/shop/rejectodemo" rel="nofollow">Rejecto</a> plugin for OpenEars.</p>
