						<![CDATA[
						<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that when I include certain words, Openears will not start listening. </p>
<p>Some examples are:  @&#8221;CHARLAS&#8221;, @&#8221;CHARLO, @&#8221;ESCUCHAS&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using JSGF (which works great otherwise, by the way!). Remove all of these words, listening will start as normal. Include one or all of these words, and Openears will not start listening. </p>
<p>That is, it will perform all of its usual initializing, but it STOPS after &#8220;Recognition loop has started&#8221;:  </p>
<p><em>&#8220;Project has these words or phrases in its dictionary:</p>
<p>[list of words]</p>
<p>Recognition loop has started&#8221;</em></p>
<p>and then no further messages in the console.  </p>
<p>By the way, thanks for the fix that resulted from my previous thread.<br />

2014-05-21 16:40:05.568 Flash[7177:60b] If this is happening more frequently than you would expect, the most likely cause for it is since you are using the Spanish phonetic lookup dictionary is that your words are not in Spanish or aren&#8217;t dictionary words, or that you are submitting the words in lowercase when they need to be entirely written in uppercase.<br />

						<p>Thank you for the complete logging output. These are the errors from your log leading to the issue as shown in the verbosePocketsphinx output:</p>
<pre>
ERROR: “file_omitted”, line 0: Line 3: Phone ‘C’ is mising in the acoustic model; word ‘CHARLAS’ ignored
[....]
ERROR: “file_omitted”, line 0: The word ‘CHARLAS’ is missing in the dictionary
</pre>
<p>First it can&#8217;t add the word because there is a wrong phoneme for the acoustic model and then it can&#8217;t find it for the finite state grammar because it didn&#8217;t add it to the dictionary, which is apparently an exit condition for JSGF but not for ARPA, so thanks very much for reporting this since it was also silently affecting ARPA models.</p>
<p>This appears to be a bug in the fallback method for Spanish phoneme generation. I could fix it locally by opening up the OpenEars file Sscribe.m and changing line 47 which currently reads as follows:</p>
<pre>
@"ch" : @" C H ",
</pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre>
@"ch" : @" CH ",
</pre>
<p>Can you make this change, re-compile the OpenEars framework, and confirm to me that this fixes the problem for you? If it does, can you let me know if you see the issue with any other words or phonemes so we can troubleshoot any other occurrences of this problem at the same time before I release a fix? Thank you.</p>

						<p>Thanks, I&#8217;ll give it a try later and let you know.</p>
<p>I suspect it&#8217;s only ch, but I&#8217;ll definitely let you know if I see any others.</p>
<p>Makes sense as I never had a problem with listening starting under arpa.</p>
