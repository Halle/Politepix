						<p>Hi All:</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience using OpenEars on Mac OS X?  I know it&#8217;s not built for the Mac architecture, but since they&#8217;re similar backends, I think it might be possible&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

						<p>Welcome, </p>
<p>Unfortunately it can&#8217;t because the audio driver is extremely adapted to iOS audio, and I haven&#8217;t ported it because I think dealing with all of the possible variations in OS X desktop audio would be a huge support job but for a much smaller userbase, so basically not a good fit for a project such as this one. Sorry I can&#8217;t help you with that, pf.</p>
