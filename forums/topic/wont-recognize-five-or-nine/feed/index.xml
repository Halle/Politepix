						<p>Hi Halle,<br />
I have a dictionary as follows:<br />
 NSArray *firstLanguageArray = @[@&#8221;THE NUMBER IS ZERO&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS ONE&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS TWO&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS THREE&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS FOUR&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS FIVE&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS SIX&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS SEVEN&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS EIGHT&#8221;,<br />
                                    @&#8221;THE NUMBER IS NINE&#8221;];</p>
<p>the problem is that it will not recognize the phrases with five or nine.  I&#8217;m trying it with different people and different iphones and it does not recognize. This is very frustrating and I&#8217;ve put tons of time into implementing this. Do you have any ideas.<br />
This will be a show stopper for me unfortunately unless I can make this work.<br />
Any thoughts are most welcome.<br />
Thanks.</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are a lot of discussions on these forums and Stack Overflow as well about the basic difficulty in offline speech recognition for recognizing contextless and rhyming one-syllable utterances like letters and numbers (there is actually a forum topic about this on the front page of the OpenEars forum topic list right now, or you can search for the keyword &#8216;numbers&#8217;). So, I can&#8217;t help you with your basic premise of an app which has required functionality based on this not-particularly-solved problem in speech recognition.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is very frustrating and Iâ€™ve put tons of time into implementing this.</p></blockquote>
<p>First apps are time-consuming and frustrating, and it&#8217;s normal to attribute that to whatever non-trivial core technology you&#8217;re using for it. I have also put serious time into supporting you although most of your questions are about your programming learning process, and that&#8217;s OK (we&#8217;ve all been there), but misattributed venting of your development stress to me isn&#8217;t a constructive path to go down (although we&#8217;ve all been there).</p>
<p>There are a couple of issues with your language model that could be improved. Your goal of only having utterances that take the form of:</p>
<p>&#8220;THE NUMBER IS _______&#8221;</p>
<p>Is not something that can be expressed by a statistical language model, which deals with probabilities rather than requirements. You want a grammar, which is a way of expressing an absolute rule for a matching utterance. Correct use of a grammar will limit the search field a bit more for your number at the end and could perhaps give a small improvement. This is a starting point for reading about grammars:</p>
<p><a href="/2014/04/10/openears-1-7-introducing-dynamic-grammar-generation/">/2014/04/10/openears-1-7-introducing-dynamic-grammar-generation/</a></p>
<p>For difficulties which arise when implementing this as a grammar, don&#8217;t forget to search these forums first for other developer&#8217;s similar questions that may have been answered. Good luck!</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,Thanks a lot for the very helpful response.  I&#8217;ll go through all of this carefully.<br />
BTW, I didn&#8217;t mean to attribute my frustration toward you, and I apologize for making it seem that way. This is quite the journey and I&#8217;m learning every minute.  I very much appreciate your help along the way.<br />
Happy New Year.</p>
