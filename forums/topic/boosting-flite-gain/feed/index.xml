						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using flitecontroller to generate wav files; I&#8217;ve modified the openears framework accordingly, saving the file instead of sending it to the AVSoundPlayer to speak.  I play the wavs with an existing (cocos2d-based) sound engine. </p>
<p>However I would like to increase the volume of the flite output. Relative to music at the same volume setting,  its very hard to hear. </p>
<p>I found the flit-&gt;gain in rate_conv.c, set to 0.8. I&#8217;ve tried setting this as high as 20 but I think it only goes up to 1.0. In any event, its still too low for me. </p>
<p>The app I&#8217;m using this in previously used speech files generated on a server using Festival, and to make those loud enough I had passed a -scale parameter of 2 to the text2wave program. I don&#8217;t really see any corresponding volume scaling feature in flite. </p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>I think in this case I&#8217;d just write a little gain-increasing method to loop through buffers of the returned TTS speech right before they are added to the virtual WAV file in FliteController and boost them. I like this StackOverflow thread for a good starting point:</p>

						<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>That SO question has the goods. I&#8217;m not much for C programming, but I know how to use a C function in an Obj C class, so I used the ScaleAudioFileAmplitude function shown there. </p>
<p>This probably is a bit wasteful, as my modified flitecontroller writes the data to file then reads/writes it again with the amplification,  but it works very well.  And quicker than me figuring out how to iterate through the data part of the buffer in memory. </p>

						<p>I think that&#8217;s a sensible solution. There are a lot of places in buffer operations to make little mistakes that can waste a day or more.</p>
