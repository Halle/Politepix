						<![CDATA[
						<p>I’m trying to implement an app that reads letters and numbers. I’ve had some inaccuracies for certain letter combinations—“AB” is consistently heard as ”8Y,” for instance, and am wondering if there are any configuration options that might help. I’ve had some success replacing letters with equivalents: ‘b’ with “bee,” etc. I have had much more success using the NATO alphabet (alpha, beta, etc.), but we can’t expect our users to be able to use it. So… what’s the best way to approach single letters? Thanks in advance.</p>

<pre><code>Language model created by QuickLM on Tue Apr 26 11:48:40 EDT 2011
Copyright (c) 1996-2010 Carnegie Mellon University and Alexander I. Rudnicky

The model is in standard ARPA format, designed by Doug Paul while he was at MITRE.

The code that was used to produce this language model is available in Open Source.
Please visit http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/ for more information

The (fixed) discount mass is 0.5. The backoffs are computed using the ratio method.

<p>The trouble is that it’s just not accurate enough distinguishing letters. I’m very new at using OpenEars/PocketSphinx, so really I just don’t know how to approach improving accuracy.</p>

						<p>Can I also see the dictionary?  I&#8217;m surprised to hear that it is recognizing EIGHT Y for A B; the EIGHT isn&#8217;t surprising but the Y is. Is EIGHT Y an accurate transcription of what Pocketsphinx heard? What is the hypothesis (verbatim)?</p>

						<p>OK, I think the first easy step is to get rid of the pronunciations that are in the dictionary that you definitely don&#8217;t want to recognize. I realize this isn&#8217;t at all self-evident so I&#8217;ll explain briefly. If you look at this from the dictionary:</p>
<p>A	AH<br />
A(2)	EY</p>
<p>That means that the language model tool gave you back two possible pronunciations for the word A. The first one is the particular NA pronunciation of the article &#8220;a&#8221; as in &#8220;a dog barked&#8221; that rhymes with &#8220;huh&#8221;. Since you don&#8217;t ever want to recognize that pronunciation of &#8220;a&#8221; because the alphabet character is never pronounced that way, you should erase that pronunciation from your dictionary.</p>
<p>The (2) in parentheses just means that it is the second pronunciation of the word, so the way you would want to replace</p>
<p>A	AH<br />
A(2)	EY</p>
<p>is with the line</p>
<p>A	EY</p>
<p>deleting the first pronunciation, and removing the (2) from the second pronunciation since it is now the only pronunciation you are going to accept.</p>
<p>The next thing that you can do is to make the sentence &#8220;A B&#8221; part of your corpus.  The corpus can have individual words, but it can also contain combinations of words. Combinations of words that you have made part of your corpus will have an automatically higher probability of being detected.</p>
<p>So, the corpus would say something like this:</p>
<p>A<br />
B<br />
A B<br />
C<br />
D<br />
E<br />
F<br />
G<br />
H<br />
I<br />
J<br />
K<br />
L<br />
M<br />
N<br />
O<br />
P<br />
Q<br />
R<br />
S<br />
T<br />
U<br />
V<br />
W<br />
X<br />
Y<br />
Z<br />
ONE<br />
TWO<br />
THREE<br />
FOUR<br />
FIVE<br />
SIX<br />
SEVEN<br />
EIGHT<br />
NINE<br />
ZERO</p>
<p>You can do this for all of the possible combinations if you want to, or just the ones where you want to raise their probability of being detected.  When you look at the language model that is output, you will see that there is a 2-gram entry for A B and that it has a raised probability.</p>

						<p>Interesting. I’ll try pruning the dictionary of ambiguous pronunciations where possible. I’d like to do more with combinations like “A B”, but the that the characters being read to this application are random, so there won’t really be a pattern to which ones get combined more.</p>
<p>Thanks for this help; I’ll report back if it’s more successful.</p>
