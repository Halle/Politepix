						<![CDATA[
						<p>Inside pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis I am seeing the error message<br />
 aq@0x90ee000: ConvertInput using invalid anchor time</p>
<p>And if OpenEarsLogging is turned on, it is then followed by<br />
Error -66681: Unable to start the Audio Queue.</p>
<p>This error appears when I make the first method call out from within the pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis method.</p>
<p>For example, I create a simple method, dummy(), which gets called from within pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis. The error appears when this method is called:<br />
 &#8211; (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID {<br />
     [self dummy]; /// DEBUG<br />
&#8230;..<br />
&#8230;..</p>
<p>And from that point on, no fliteController output occurs and no more speech recognition occurs.<br />
My code has previously worked fine, so It seems to be something I have changed, but I have been unable to track down what it is. Any suggestions?</p>

						<p>OK, I&#8217;ve discovered something more about this. This error seems to occur because the class that this code is in is both an OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegate and an AVAudioPlayerDelegate.</p>
<p>@interface Speech : NSObject</p>
<p>This is because it plays some pre-recorded sound clips as well as fliteController output, and I want to know when the clips are started and finished so i can turn off speech recognition during those sounds.<br />
If I remove the &#8216;AVAudioPlayerDelegate&#8217;, I seem to be able run consistently without the error occurring.</p>
<p>Is it valid to have the class as a delegate of both? Could there be some conflict that is causing this error and lock-up?</p>

						<p>Interesting. We know that there isn&#8217;t an inherent conflict between a class inheriting the delegate protocols of OpenEarsEventsObserver and AVAudioPlayer because FliteController inherits the delegate protocols of both. But I don&#8217;t think your interpretation is offbase because there is a lot going on there &#8212; the recognition audio unit, FliteController&#8217;s audio and its callbacks, and your audio and its callbacks.</p>
<p>Do you want to show me some logs featuring OpenEarsLogging and verbosePocketSphinx for the timeframe in which this is occurring? Maybe there are some hints.</p>
<p>Something to just double-check is that a lot of AVAudioPlayer sample code contains unneeded calls to AVAudioSession and a lot of developers who asked me about similar issues found calls to the audio session in their code that were responsible. It might be worth a quick project-wide search for &#8220;audiosession&#8221; without case matching to make sure that some audio session overrides didn&#8217;t sneak in there.</p>

						<p>OK, I&#8217;ve done what you suggested, but first, something didn&#8217;t paste correctly in my earlier message, because it got the angle brackets confused with html brackets. The line<br />
@interface Speech : NSObject<br />
should have shown as<br />
<code><br />
@interface Speech : NSObject {OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegate, AVAudioPlayerDelegate}<br />
</code><br />
(except replace the braces with angle brackets).</p>
<p>A search for AudioSession revealed the two methods: audioSessionInterruptionDidBegin and audioSessionInterruptionDidEnd, but commenting them out didn&#8217;t fix the problem.  Here is the output:</p>

						<p>Also, the above output is followed by the line </p>
<p>2012-10-14 16:15:29.380 RR[68064:c07] Flite sending interrupt speech request.</p>
<p>before returning to the main loop.</p>
<p>And to complicate it a bit more, i have now removed the inheritance from AVAudioPlayerDelegate, which fixed the problem yesterday, but now i am still getting the error &#8211; so it may not have been the cause. </p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>I&#8217;ve now discovered that it seems to be to do with having 2 OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegates in the system. I had my main ViewController as an OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegate so that it can change the user interface when fliteController output starts and stops. i also had another class, Speech, as a second OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegate so that it can process the speech. In my view controller, if i set the delegate to &#8216;this&#8217;, the error occurs, but if i omit that line (leaving only one delegate in the system &#8211; the Speech class), the error does not occur. So i think i can reorganise my code to have only one delegate and have it inform the other class of the OpenEars events when they occur.</p>

						<p>That is a little bit unlikely as the underlying cause since OpenEars itself has at least two OpenEarsEventsObservers instantiated internally, then add your first one and you&#8217;re up to a minimum of three out of the gate.</p>
<p>Not debating that it is helping the issue you are seeing, just that it is probably ultimately due to something else. I haven&#8217;t seen the full logs and I imagine there are nuances to the code that can&#8217;t be put across via small snippets but it would be great if you could email me a stripped-down test case. Looking at this report of the same issue, it really looks like the audio session category is being overridden somewhere:</p>

						<p>Thanks for this answer &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you are right &#8211; there must have been some memory corruption somewhere that was causing this side effect. I have now completely rewritten my app and have not (yet!) seen the problem. </p>
