						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello,<br />
I&#8217;m using Open Ears to recognize essentially words one by one and no complete sentences. Thus, I regularly have short utterances (less than 1-2 seconds) and sometimes pocketsphinx isn&#8217;t going into the decoding process or it&#8217;s not very responsive (starts decoding a bit late).<br />
I&#8217;m aware that my use case is not the optimal one for pocketsphinx, but I was wondering if it was possible to optimize it for this type of utterances ?<br />
I know that in earlier version of Open Ears it was possible to set kSecondsOfSilenceToDetect so that pocketsphinx would get into decoding faster, but I can&#8217;t find it in the last version.<br />
Thank you for your help!</p>

						<p>Sure, check out the float property of PocketsphinxController &#8220;secondsOfSilenceToDetect&#8221;. I just moved it into the class so you could set it programmatically.</p>

						<p>Cool thank you ! It is definitely faster now.<br />
Do you have any other advices to optimize for short utterances ? Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to get Sphinx into the decoding process, I have to repeat several times the same word or to speak very close to the microphone. Maybe it&#8217;s a microphone configuration issue ?<br />
My app runs on iPad.</p>

						<p>You could try <a href="/rapidears" rel="nofollow">RapidEars</a> and see if it helps if you&#8217;re open to non-free solutions. If I recall correctly, your implementation isn&#8217;t a supported method, so you might have audio session problems.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m doing something similar &#8211; what value would you recommend and what values are acceptable?  The default is one correct?  Can you use something like .5?</p>

						<p>I would recommend reducing it and doing some user testing to see what the minimum is for your application before you have an issue with utterances being cut off.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Was trying to lower secondsOfSilenceToDetect to very low values but it doesnt seem to work at all.<br />
In log there is always:<br />
2012-09-27 23:47:18.423 TestOpenEars[1650:907] Pocketsphinx has detected a second of silence, concluding an utterance.<br />
And I would really like to have only half second delay or maybe even 0.33<br />
Is it possible? Or to get it paid plugin is needed?</p>

						<p>The log always says &#8220;a second of silence&#8221; because that&#8217;s just what an NSLog statement says in the sample app. It isn&#8217;t related to the functionality of the property secondsOfSilenceToDetect and the log statement doesn&#8217;t come from the framework. </p>
<p>secondsOfSilenceToDetect defaults to .7 seconds currently and if you change it it will be shorter or longer, but the difference between .7 seconds and for instance .33 isn&#8217;t going to be a big perceptual difference (although the very short delay can cause issues since any intermittent noise followed by a pause can trigger recognition) because you will still have the following sequence of events which all use time: the speech continuing until to completion, the silence after the complete speech, and then the time to process the complete speech.</p>
<p>RapidEars doesn&#8217;t use a period of silence at all because it recognizes speech while the speech is in-progress rather than performing recognition on a completed statement (for instance, if you say &#8220;go right&#8221; it will first return the live hypotheses &#8220;go&#8221; and then &#8220;go right&#8221; as you are in the process of speaking the phrase &#8212; RapidEars doesn&#8217;t wait for a silence period to recognize). For your goal of using OpenEars-style speech recognition that only happens after a silence but with a shorter silence period it isn&#8217;t necessary for you to use RapidEars. But, since OpenEars defaults to a short period of silence out of the box, the differences from shortening it more than the default aren&#8217;t going to be dramatic; expect it to be a smaller change in the user experience.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;ve fixed the NSLog statement for the next version so the sample app doesn&#8217;t create confusion about the framework behavior and updated the online documentation and tutorial.</p>
