						<p>Hi Richa,</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like help with your issues, please take a look at this post:</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/install-issues-and-their-solutions/">/forums/topic/install-issues-and-their-solutions/</a></p>
<p>And show the code that you have written. I am happy to help but it isn&#8217;t possible to give help with an issue like this without any information about your code and what you have tried already, since the fliteDidFinishSpeaking delegate function is known to work.</p>
<p>When you show your code, please show the parts where you set the delegate of OpenEarsEventsObserver. Thanks!</p>
