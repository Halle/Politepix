						<p>I have a few words that my app listens for, things like &#8220;set&#8221;, &#8220;ok&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is, it has a min dog it&#8217;s own and picks up on the slightest of background noise and detects it as a word.</p>
<p>If I just mumble something random it gets detected.</p>
<p>Is there any way of reducing the sensitivity?</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>For the issue of quiet background noises being detected as speech, take a look at the vadThreshold property of OEPocketsphinxController â€“ it may be too low for your application. For the issue of intentionally-spoken out-of-vocabulary words being recognized as words in your vocabulary, check out Rejecto.</p>

						<p>Sorry, no sale plans at the moment, but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s helpful for the issue. If there are any interesting product developments to report I usually send them out in the newsletter, and the newsletters generally come with a coupon, so the best bet is to subscribe to the newsletter.</p>

						<p>TBH it&#8217;s actually my preference that developers test the demos for a bit and solve a few of their integration questions before purchasing, since there&#8217;s really no rush and it leads to the best outcomes.</p>
