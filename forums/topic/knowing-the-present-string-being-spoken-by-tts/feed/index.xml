						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it just the string that you have entered into FliteController&#8217;s say:withVoice: method? Maybe I&#8217;m not understanding your question 100%, can you elaborate on why you can&#8217;t use your own string that you entered into say:withVoice:?</p>

						<p>OK, that makes sense, but there is no callback which identifies the word that is being spoken because the entire phase is synthesized at once when you use FliteController. The best workaround would be to send a series of very short statements, highlighting the statement as you send it.</p>
