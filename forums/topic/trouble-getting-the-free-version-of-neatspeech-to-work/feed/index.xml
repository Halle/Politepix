						<p>Hi</p>
<p>I normally use flite directly for my apps but thought I&#8217;d give OpenEars and NeatSpeech a try. I wrote a small demo for all the voices to test them out. I have OpenEars working fine but when I tried to integrate NeatSpeech I keep getting an unrecognized selector error. I&#8217;m trying to get Emma&#8217;s voice working to begin with.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the error (with Zombie objects enabled):<br />
2013-05-07 16:44:46.418 OpenEarsTest[65073:c07] -[FliteController sayWithNeatSpeech:withVoice:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x95a84b0<br />
2013-05-07 16:44:46.419 OpenEarsTest[65073:c07] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception &#8216;NSInvalidArgumentException&#8217;, reason: &#8216;-[FliteController sayWithNeatSpeech:withVoice:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x95a84b0&#8217;</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re following the instructions in the tutorial here:</p>
<p><a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a></p>
<p>Pay extra attention to step 1 from &#8220;Preparing to use Plugins&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Then open up the Build Settings tab of the target app project and find the entry &#8220;Other Linker Flags&#8221; and add the linker flag &#8220;-ObjC&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;ve done this already, make sure you&#8217;ve done it for the target you&#8217;re compiling to.</p>
