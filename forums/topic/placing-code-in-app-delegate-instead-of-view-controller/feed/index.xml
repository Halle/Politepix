						<p>Am I correct in thinking that I can place openears code into the app delegate instead of view controller code? I&#8217;d like to be able to use it on different screens and dynamically load different vocabularies depending on the screen.</p>

						<p>Sure, if you like, or for a more standard architecture you can also put it in a root-level view controller and send commands back to it via delegate callbacks from the child controllers. The only thing I don&#8217;t support is putting it in a singleton because that usually goes badly due to all of the multithreading.</p>

						<p>No problem, this is what I had in mind with the design so I&#8217;m happy when it&#8217;s used this way.</p>
