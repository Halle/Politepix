						<![CDATA[
						<p>With neatspeech is it possible to change the pitch without recreating the voice object as this takes time? I have tried using the voice pitch variable however it doesn&#8217;t seem to update the pitch. I have also tried using the fliteController duration_stretch variable but this seems to be ignored if neatspeech libraries are included. To get duration_stretch to work I have to switch back to OpenEars slt and remove the neatspeech libraries.</p>
<p>Example code:<br />
voice = [[William alloc] initWithPitch:pitch speed:speed transform:transform];<br />
[self.fliteController sayWithNeatSpeech:text withVoice: voice];</p>
<p>// later &#8230; say with a high voice<br />
voice.pitch = 1.0;<br />
[self.fliteController sayWithNeatSpeech:othertext withVoice: voice];</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
