						<![CDATA[
						<p>I am surprised that I haven&#8217;t found any similar topics. I want to create a wake-up word scenario in which I need openears to be continuously monitoring for the wake-up keyword &#8220;OK OPENEARS&#8221;. I use a language model that contains only the wake up keyword for that. When the wake-up keyword is spotted I change the Language Model to one that contains a variety of commands. And then I change back to the &#8220;wake-up&#8221; language model after command recognition success. Questions:</p>
<p>1) Should I use Rejecto or JSGF grammar for the wake-up language model?<br />
2) In addition to the above I assume that wake-up keyword monitoring happens during music playback (from the device).  When the keyword is spotted I change the language model as I previously said but I also turn the music down waiting for a command to be spoken. That means that the background noise level changes dramatically and OpenEars needs to recalibrate. Is there a fast way to force a predefined level of calibration?<br />
3) Is this the best practice for my scenario?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am surprised that I haven’t found any similar topics.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s only that this is a specific version of a general implementation question that gets asked, i.e. how to spot a keyword. I&#8217;ll be happy to try to help you with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Should I use Rejecto or JSGF grammar for the wake-up language model?</p></blockquote>
<p>You can&#8217;t use JSGF with a single keyword match, I think. JSGF rules as implemented in Pocketsphinx have to have more than one potential match or they crash, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p> Is there a fast way to force a predefined level of calibration?</p></blockquote>
<p>You won&#8217;t get good results from a predefined level since it depends on the environment and mic characteristics being similar to your predefined case, which is unlikely. Have you already tested and discovered that the ongoing recalibration isn&#8217;t doing the job?</p>

						<p>Actually here is what happens:<br />
1) When I turn the music up OpenEars&#8217; status is &#8220;Pocketsphinx has detected speech.&#8221; It never passes that phase as it thinks there is someone speaking instead of background music. Eventually it crashes. I need somehow to set a timeout for that and/or force a recalibration at this point.<br />
2) When I start OpenEars with loud music (not insanely loud) from the beginning and before turning the music down I have this output:<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:35.464 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Calibration time: 0<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:36.163 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx calibration has started.<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:38.367 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx calibration is complete.<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:38.369 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx is now listening.<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:38.883 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx has detected speech.<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:47.429 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx has detected a period of silence, concluding an utterance.<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:47.743 openEarsTest[6366:60b] The received hypothesis is OK OK with a score of -998 and an ID of 000000000<br />
2014-01-20 21:15:47.811 openEarsTest[6366:60b] Pocketsphinx is now listening.</p>
<p>Then if I turn the music down it seems to get my first sentences wrong. However after a few seconds it starts getting them right again.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Good to know &#8212; could you test against this beta that is designed to fix the issue where there is occasionally an endless recognition plus a crash when there is a sudden increase in volume in the background: </p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/OpenEarsDistributionBeta.tar.bz2">/wp-content/uploads/OpenEarsDistributionBeta.tar.bz2</a></p>
<p>The beta is primarily designed for fixing this problem and so far I haven&#8217;t gotten any feedback on the beta from the other developers reporting the problem, so I&#8217;d appreciate hearing whether it alleviates the issue for you.</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the logging from your app &#8212; could you show me the output with verbosePocketsphinx and OpenEarsLogging turned on so I can get some info about what is happening with the framework?</p>
<p>Make sure you clean your project and rebuild with the new framework installed to make sure you&#8217;re linking to the new version.</p>
<p>Quick question: why does your log say that your calibration time is zero?</p>
