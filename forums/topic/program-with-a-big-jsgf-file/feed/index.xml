						<p>When I use a jsgf file which has about two thousands words, it recognized quickly and the accuracy is high. But if use twenty thousands words in jsgf file, it&#8217;s very slow and accuracy is low.<br />
How can I improve it?</p>

<p>That is very surprising that you have those results on a real device. Is it possible that those are actually simulator results? JSGF with Pocketsphinx on a real device is usually going to be pretty slow with a hundred words or so, let alone thousands or tens of thousands of words.</p>

						<p>I have test Pocketsphinx in Android with the big jsgf. In Android, the initialization is slow, but the recoginzation seems good.So I test it in IOS.</p>
<p>Is it better to use ARPA if I have thousands of words?</p>

<p>On which Android device do you have fast recognition with a JSGF with thousands of words?</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it better to use ARPA if I have thousands of words?</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be faster, yes.</p>
