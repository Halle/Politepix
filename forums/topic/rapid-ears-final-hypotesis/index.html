		<p>Hi!<br>
It&#8217;s me again!<br>
Is there a way to get final hypothesis of all speech from Rapid Ears?</p>
<p>I checked pocketsphinx and don&#8217;t find property or method for this.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<p>Yes, take a look at the RapidEars documentation or Pocketsphinx+RapidEars.h header so you can see all of the RapidEars methods. You will need to set RapidEars&#8217; finalizeHypothesis property and also add the appropriate OEEventsObserver+RapidEars callback.</p>

		<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>Sorry, I meant another thing. I have already set FinalizeHypothesis to YES, and also I added code to delegate rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis. But &#8220;rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis&#8221; is called not exactly after user pause his speech, but after some delay (1-2 seconds).</p>
<p>Is there some other way to get final hypothesis, probably at point when we call pocketsphinx stopListening method?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<p>My instinct about it is that it is originating through an interaction with your other audio settings somehow. On a modern device (any device that can run iOS 8.1) I would expect that to take about a second and probably including the period of the pause.</p>
<p>Normally at this point I would ask you to try to replicate it using the replication technique so I can take a look:</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/">https://www.politepix.com/forums/topic/how-to-create-a-minimal-case-for-replication/</a></p>
<p>That is basically taking the sample app, replacing its vocabulary with your vocabulary, and adding the RapidEars methods (but not adding any of the other features of your app). My guess is that you won&#8217;t see the same lag in this case, but if you do, you can then make a recording of your session using SaveThatWave so I can replicate the same session and see what is happening. There is more info in the forum post I linked to. I think this would be a good next step because it looks like there are many things going on in your app session which have the capability of interacting with the audio requirements for OpenEars, so it&#8217;s hard to give troubleshooting advice on the app with all the other features integrated.</p>

		<blockquote><p>In app I also changed audio session category and options. May this affect on open ears?</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely – making changes to the audio session, having other audio and video objects working simultaneously, anything which changes the session at all will affect OpenEars because it has required session settings. It&#8217;s possible to overlook something if you have other SDKs in use – safer than commenting things out would be to create a really simple implementation based on the sample app and see if it is still happening.</p>

		<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay. This seems to just be an expected delay as a result of there being sound in the background (ping-pong and conversation) which is extending the recognition period so it can&#8217;t complete when the intentional speech is done.</p>
