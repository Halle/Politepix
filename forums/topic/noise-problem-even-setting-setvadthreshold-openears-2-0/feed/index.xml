						<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I was using until now openears 1.66 in an app which is currently working in Spanish and I have to say that I was really happy with the results and the accuracy.<br />
Then some days ago I realized that this version has problems with &#8220;ch&#8221; middle-phonemes words.<br />
For instance:<br />
&#8220;Leche&#8221; is working perfectly but however &#8220;Lechuga&#8221; is impossible to recognize.<br />
Then I read on the changelog the correction on 1.7.1 version about spanish phonemes and I guess this will solve my problem and I will be the happiest guy in the world :D. But I cannot download this version only the 2.0.<br />
I tried the 2.0 and then the words with &#8220;ch&#8221; in the middle are working now but the accuracy is worse than 1.66 and with a TV making noises in background openears is too sensitive and is crazy how it keeps listening in comparison with 1.66. I read all the post about that and I tried to change the values:</p>
<pre><code>[[OEPocketsphinxController sharedInstance] setSecondsOfSilenceToDetect:0.2];
 [[OEPocketsphinxController sharedInstance] setVadThreshold:3.0];</code></pre>
<p>but does not seems to do anything, I don&#8217;t feel any difference perhaps I am setting the values in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Anyway, could I download or get 1.7.1 version somehow?, would be awesome. I don&#8217;t find it in any place. If it is not possible, please could you help me to use 2.0 correctly?.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance ! and really you are doing a good job</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>A couple of things that should help. </p>
<p>The first is that you can&#8217;t use unrealistically low secondsOfSilenceToDetect values like .1 or .2 with OpenEars 2.0 anymore. There isn&#8217;t an advantage to using a pause detection of a length which is less than a speaker&#8217;s actual pause (at least .3 seconds if not more) so this has never provided a benefit as a UI for the user and causes actual speech to be interrupted, as well as speech-like sounds to be submitted constantly for recognition. It doesn&#8217;t result in a real-time-like user experience because speech still has to be processed as a whole, and it is more frequently in the process of being submitted for recognition, meaning it is likely to not be listening at the time that the user is speaking due to processing. </p>
<p>secondsOfSilenceToDetect values that were significantly shorter than a speaker&#8217;s pause have been the cause of almost all of the issues reported for 2.0, so it&#8217;s pretty likely I&#8217;m going to limit that property to realistic values in upcoming versions. It will need to be increased to a value greater than .2 for 2.0.</p>
<p>From the upgrade guide: </p>
<pre>
Another API change is that before you start setting properties of OEPocketsphinxController for the first time, it is necessary to call its setActive method:

[[OEPocketsphinxController sharedInstance] setActive:TRUE error:nil];
</pre>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t called setActive: and your vadThreshold settings are the first properties you&#8217;re setting, this will cause them not to take effect.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can set vadThreshold to a value higher than 3.0 if 3.0 is still causing oversensitive recognition, although this is probably more due to the secondsOfSilenceToDetect setting.</p>
<p>Sorry, it isn&#8217;t possible to offer dual support to 1.x and 2.x simultaneously â€“ if there are issues with 2.0 they need to be reported and then they will be fixed.</p>

						<p>Thanks Halle for that fast answer. </p>
<p>Ok I will try the couple of things you told me, but then before I would like to know a couple of things to fully understand how this is working. </p>
<p>First, what are the realistic values for secondsOfSilenceToDetect being the minimum .3 as you told me? What would be the best value for you if I tell you that I&#8217;m recognizing maximum 3 words in a phrase but normally it will be just one word?</p>
<p>Another thing is, I would like to know what is the maximum value for the vadThreshold to play with it. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot </p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The maximum value for vadThreshold is 4.0. </p>
<p>I would expect 2.0-3.0 to work fine for most applications as long as the secondsOfSilenceToDetect has a realistic relationship with user pauses.</p>
<p>Regarding secondsOfSilenceToDetect, the smallest value I would expect to begin to give a good user experience is .3, since that is getting towards the average durations that speakers pause between utterances. I would probably expect it to be a bit larger at .4 or maybe .5 since the intention isn&#8217;t to only catch the speech of speakers whose pauses are shorter than the average.</p>
<p>If you are ever trying to recognize more than one word at a time this should be a value that is distinctly longer than a normal inter-word pause, since setting it to the same length or shorter means you are insuring that the user will have their speech interrupted and recognized while they are still in the process of active app-directed speech, and that also means their subsequent speech will not be heard by the engine while it is in the process of performing recognition on the partial speech that it interrupted, which is a big downside risk for a speech UX. That&#8217;s what the default value of .7 is meant to help with. Probably a value like .5 is still reasonable here to split the difference between good UX in terms of getting all the speech and good UX in terms of reactivity.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is a big gain in setting it to a tiny value purely in terms of the sense of reactiveness, because that latency is only going to be a small percentage of the overall interaction time which includes the time the user spoke, and their actual intended period of silence, and the time that the engine took to process the entire finalized speech, which is likely to be a minimum of 3 seconds overall (assuming that everything else that happens in your UI as a result of the speech is instantaneous), making a question of tenths of a second one way or another not the biggest part of the puzzle in terms of UX. </p>
<p>In some cases I think the idea behind setting it very low is to give a RapidEars-like lack of latency, but RapidEars returns the user speech continuously while it is still in progress, which is just a very different UX to the UX of complete utterances being analyzed after they have been finished, regardless of the secondsOfSilenceToDetect time.</p>
<p>In the absence of a real-time approach like that in RapidEars, I think it&#8217;s likely to make speech UI users happier when the secondsOfSilenceToDetect corresponds to their intention to denote that their app-directed speech is finished, versus other events such as a inter-word pause or hesitation.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hi, </p>
<p>regarding what you you told me about where to set the vadThreshold and secondsOfSilenceToDetect, I was setting those values before setActive line, so I would expect that when I move it after this line I would feel a real difference. But I am sorry, nothing changed.</p>
<p>Tests:</p>
<p>vadThreshold = 4.0 (maximun)<br />
secondsOfSilenceToDetect= 0.3</p>
<p>and with the TV in background with a normal level of sound, the recognition does not stop &#8230; and it recognize 6 or 7 words.. when I just said one.</p>
<p>after this test I changed secondsOfSilenceToDetect to 0.4 and 0.5 but not with better results&#8230; I really don&#8217;t get what&#8217;s going on. What am I doing wrong, Halle? </p>
<p>Could I get somehow 1.7.1 version ? I would like to make tests with it to see the results. </p>
<p>Thanks, I hope we can get this working</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>OK, can you make a replication case for me so I can see what you&#8217;re seeing exactly? </p>
<p>What I would need is a recording of your speech (in the environment you&#8217;re describing) added to pathToTestFile (there is a commented-out usage of pathToTestFile in the sample app and you can read more about it in OEPocketsphinxController.h) and the changes to the sample app which will demonstrate this issue (I believe the only changes should be vadThreshold, secondsOfSilenceToDetect, the generation of your language model, and the selection of the Spanish acoustic model). Once you can demonstrate the issue to yourself using the sample app, contact me through the contact form with a place to download your recording and a description of your changes to the sample app and I will test it out and get back to you. Sorry you&#8217;re having this issue and I promise I&#8217;ll check it out.</p>

// I&#039;ve provided some pretty granular information about the exact phase of the Pocketsphinx listening loop, the Audio Session, and Flite, but I&#039;d expect

//
//- (void) pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis:(NSString *)hypothesis recognitionScore:(NSString *)recognitionScore utteranceID:(NSString *)utteranceID;

<p>How far did you get with the problem I was facing ? as you see the recognition thread never ends while my recording is working (because the TV in background) with 1.x it&#8217;s stop in every word I say. That&#8217;s the problem I think. 2.0 never stops listening because the noise.</p>
<p>By the way, playing around your nice framework I just realized if you add any word that before was not recognizing to the <strong>LanguageModelGeneratorLookupList.text</strong> file then the recognition works perfectly. So my problem is solved for one specific word which is crazy if I have to add all the words which the framework is not recognizing.<br />
Then I looked at the same file in 2.0 version and I see that that dictionary is exactly the same like 1.x but still it is working for words that 1.x does not recognize except that you add them to the dictionary.<br />
I hope it helps you to find what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>Yep, I&#8217;ve taken a look at your example and I think I have an idea what the issue is due to. I will be running tests for a few days and then I may have either a fix to push or a beta for you to check out. I appreciate the good example, it was very helpful.</p>
