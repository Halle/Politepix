		<p>Hi!<br>
I have updated Rapid Ears to latest version and found that after some time it just detects silence even though I&#8217;m speaking.</p>
<p>I also have spotted one line in logs which doesn&#8217;t appear when silence is detected under normal circumstances.<br>
<code>An utterance appears to be stuck in listening mode. Exiting stuck utterance.</code></p>
<p>Here is full log:</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>RapidEars has to eventually detect silence and start a new live utterance when the live utterance is getting to be about half a minute – that is expected behavior. Have you set secondsOfSilenceToDetect to a very long value? If you set it to a normal value it will handle separations between utterances more gracefully than how it has to do it when it ends up with an extremely long continuous live utterance.</p>

		<p>Sorry, no – you have to expect a new utterance to begin after a continuous live utterance that is around 30 seconds. It actually used to be a much longer gap between live utterances and has become a lot shorter in the last few RapidEars updates so I&#8217;m a bit surprised to hear it&#8217;s an issue now. Where in the logs are you seeing that it&#8217;s a second? Keep in mind that .7 seconds is the detected pause length so that duration is always going to be a factor in the separation between two utterances.</p>
<p>What is unusual about this case is that a normal user would rarely be capable of speaking for around 30 continuous seconds without a notable pause. People don&#8217;t really speak that way in practice unless they are reading from a text and intentionally trying not to pause at all. If you want to prompt a faster separation between utterances, pick a slightly shorter secondsOfSilenceToDetect like .5 so that it happens more regularly and not at the point that RapidEars has detected what it thinks is a stuck utterance, which is what happens when one single live utterance exceeds 30 seconds, since that is a rarity in normal practice and generally indicates that something is wrong (like a loud continuous noise in the background that isn&#8217;t expected to stop).</p>

		<p>I would need a replication case in order to take a look at this further. If you aren&#8217;t using final recognition, make sure that you have setFinalizeHypothesis: set to FALSE, since it sounds a bit like a super-long hypothesis is being submitted to the final hyp method when your live recognition is eventually interrupted.</p>

		<p>Before I take a look at it, please confirm that you still have this issue with setFinalizeHypothesis:FALSE, thanks. If RapidEars is being asked to process the final hypothesis as well, it has to finish that before it can start a new live hyp. If it is given 30 seconds of speech all at once, that can take a long time.</p>

		<p>Correct, this is designed for the case like yours, where you want to do many live recognitions one after the other without ever having the hypothesis submitted for a final recognition.</p>
<p>By the way, the last version of OpenEars no longer requires that you use all capital letters (this has no effect on recognition quality), and it removes the characters it can&#8217;t process on its own, so you can probably take that part out of your code.</p>
