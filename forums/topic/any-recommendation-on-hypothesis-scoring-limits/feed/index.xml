						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here are the previous discussions:</p>
<p><a href="/forums/topic/how-does-recognition-score-works/">/forums/topic/how-does-recognition-score-works/</a><br />
<a href="/forums/topic/scores-used-in-openears/">/forums/topic/scores-used-in-openears/</a></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t use ranges to limit because you don&#8217;t know what the environmental factors are, but something you can experiment with is detecting cases where the top n-best and the second-closest n-best are close and the overall range is large. i.e. 1-best is -50000 and 2-best is -50500 suggests to me that it&#8217;s a close call. But you can&#8217;t say &#8220;below -50000 is wrong&#8221;.</p>
