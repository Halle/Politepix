						<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I was using an old version of OpenEars without any problems. Today I decided to download the last one (1.2.4) and give it a try.<br />
 &#8211; I generate my Language Model and Dictionary using LanguageModelGenerator with no problem at all.<br />
 &#8211; I start the startVoiceRecognitionThread with no errors<br />
 &#8211; I speak and the library detects something happend BUT:</p>
<p>the pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis method is never called.</p>
<p>Any thoughts that could guide me</p>
<p>Thank you all very much</p>
<p>Regards</p>

						<p>Hmm, this is known working without any issues, so I think it&#8217;s just going to turn out to be OpenEarsEventsObserver delegate method connection issue.</p>

						<p>Oh, I just noticed this from your question &#8212; there is no public method called startVoiceRecognitionThread, so calling a method with this name is probably the issue. If you are doing anything with PocketsphinxController&#8217;s threading it will probably cause issues since PocketsphinxController handles its own multithreading. Maybe the best approach is to do a new installation based on the tutorial: <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a></p>
