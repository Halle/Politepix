						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>OpenEars could be much more easily be used as a part of a large project if only it were supported on Cocoapods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to make a Cocoa podspec for it, including all OpenEar sources and its dependencies&#8217; sources into the project. However, I ran into into 37 linker errors that look like this:</p>
<p>Undefined symbols for architecture i386:<br />
  &#8220;_delete_features&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      -[GraphemeGenerator init] in libPods-VoiceArmApp.a(GraphemeGenerator.o)<br />
  &#8220;_delete_utterance&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      -[GraphemeGenerator convertGraphemes:] in libPods-VoiceArmApp.a(GraphemeGenerator.o)<br />
  &#8220;_delete_wave&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      -[FliteController say:withVoice:] in libPods-VoiceArmApp.a(FliteController.o)<br />
  &#8220;_feat_copy_into&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      -[GraphemeGenerator init] in libPods-VoiceArmApp.a(GraphemeGenerator.o)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to resolve it. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Hok</p>

						<p>Welcome Hok,</p>
<p>I am going to look into what is involved in creating a Cocoapod spec once the next round of releases are out since Orta let me know there was interest and I also think it&#8217;s a good idea if there is compatibility between the Cocoapod system and how OpenEars is developed and released. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t troubleshoot it with you in advance of getting time to look things over myself and figure out what will be involved in that task, but I wanted to let you know that I also think it would be a useful development and it is on my own task list.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s on the roadmap somewhere. It would make development with OpenEars much more manageable for everybody.</p>
<p>Cocoapods works by sticking all  Objective-C sources of a Framework into its own fake Framework directory, and then generates you a workspace that would tie your project&#8217;s various targets up with the frameworks they depend on. The main challenge is to have OpenEars&#8217; dependencies compiled and linking correctly with the rest of the sources. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a trivial task.</p>

						<p>Well, development with OpenEars is 1. dragging a folder into your project and 2. starting to code, so I&#8217;m not sure the win is that big in terms of manageability, but Cocoapods is a very cool project and I&#8217;m happy to look into participating. There are no library dependencies in the sense you&#8217;re describing since they are all shipped as part of OpenEars&#8217; distribution (using other versions of its library dependencies are probably why you have errors above), but a Cocoapods spec has to work with OpenEars&#8217; license which is not OSI.</p>
