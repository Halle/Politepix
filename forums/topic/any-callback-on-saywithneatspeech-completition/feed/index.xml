						<p>Is there some callback method like&#8230;</p>
<p><code><br />
-(void)neatSpeechTalkDidFinishOfStatement:(NSString*) statement voice:(NeatSpeechVoice*) voice;<br />
</code></p>
<p>&#8230;or so?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be happy with it, have no much intention so set up a timer and keep querying speechInProgress constantly without further information on speaking.</p>

						<p>You should be able to catch the end of a NeatSpeech utterance using the standard OpenEars OpenEarsEventsObserver delegate method &#8211; (void) fliteDidFinishSpeaking, is that not working for you? Receiving the actual string is not available.</p>

						<p>Ah, really, gotcha, thanks.<br />
I was searching for it in FliteController headers, since I was sending messages to a FliteController.</p>
<p>For the future, it could be awesome to have some info here on the <em>statements</em>, and the <em>whole statement queue</em>, and to give some context information to statements, maybe some lightweight statement object&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;without these features I have to setup many &#8220;annoying&#8221; properties in my controllers.</p>
