						<p>I am trying to use  AudioServicesPlaySystemSound  to play a small beep when the system is ready to take voice input (similar to Siri). However this does not seem to work on iOS 6 when using OpeanEars. It is working on the simulator and the same play sound code will work on the device before startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath is called.</p>
<p>Any ideas why it is not working on the device? Or any tips on ways to play a small beep when ready for voice input?</p>

						<p>This is due to the audio session settings used by the framework. If you want to sidestep the entire issue, just play the sound with AVAudioPlayer. Otherwise you can take a look at the approaches from me and others in these threads:</p>
