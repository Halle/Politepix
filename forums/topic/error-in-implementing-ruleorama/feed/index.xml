						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to implement RuleORama Plugin in my app for creating rules-based grammars for better accuracy &amp; fast recognition. I want to use it with RapidEars for increase the speed of grammar-based recognition, but I&#8217;m getting the error for implementing RuleORoma. As I&#8217;m try to install app on my device it crash. I&#8217;m following all the steps shown in tutorial but still I&#8217;m getting the error. Here is the log file, please help me where I&#8217;m getting wrong.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>To know exactly why there is a crash you&#8217;d need to also turn on verbosePocketsphinx, but this output from OpenEarsLogging is probably the underlying cause:</p>
<blockquote><p>The file you’ve sent to the decoder appears to be an ARPA-style language model based on its naming, but you have set languageModelIsJSGF: to TRUE. If you are experiencing recognition issues, there is a good chance that this is the reason for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>You probably have languageModelIsJSGF set to TRUE as a result of trying out a grammar with stock OpenEars, but when you use RuleORama, you don&#8217;t set this to TRUE. Go ahead and turn on verbosePocketsphinx to get more help.</p>
<p>A couple of other things you might want to take a look at: RapidEars doesn&#8217;t have an argument languageModelIsJSGF, so that isn&#8217;t a RapidEars listening session (in case you intend to be using RapidEars).  The other thing I noticed in the logging is that it is unlikely to be functional to create a grammar with a single word, either with stock grammars or with RuleORama. There is no strong reason to create a grammar with one word since there is no functional difference between a grammar with a single word and a statistical language model with a single word – they will bother be able to recognize either single utterances of the one word or repetitions.</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This is a different problem that the previous one, but we can troubleshoot it. Can you set this:</p>
<p>[self.pocketsphinxController setRapidEarsToVerbose:FALSE];</p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p>[self.pocketsphinxController setRapidEarsToVerbose:TRUE];</p>
<p> so we can see the verbose output from the recognizer?</p>

						<p>Thanks! Out of curiosity, do you get the same result with a simpler grammar? i.e. if you change any &#8220;CanBeSaid&#8221; statements to &#8220;WillBeSaid&#8221; so they don&#8217;t represent optional statements?</p>

						<p>I switched all of the CanBeSaid&#8217;s to WillBeSaid&#8217;s and also tried trimming the grammar to this:</p>
<p>NSDictionary *grammar = @{<br />
