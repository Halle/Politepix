						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello Halle,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m integrating OpenEars with a Unity3D game, and the game relies heavily on music and sound effects.<br />
When OpenEars starts listening, it will change the audio playback settings in a way that conflicts with Unity (which uses FMOD for sound).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed two issues when OpenEars starts listening:<br />
&#8211; Unity3D audio will completely stop unless I set a very high buffer size on the Unity side, which introduces latency<br />
&#8211; OpenEars will change the sample rate from 24000 Hz (Unity&#8217;s sample rate on iOS) to 16000 Hz, causing the sound playback quality to degrade considerably</p>
<p>Despite these audio playback issues, OpenEars recognition works perfectly. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not using Flite, so I don&#8217;t require any audio playback from OpenEars. Is it possible to make OpenEars deal only with input from the mic, while not interfering with audio playback settings?</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>
<p>PS.: I tried using AudioSessionGetProperty and AudioSessionSetProperty to check and restore the sample rate back to 24000 Hz, and while it fixed my sound quality, it broke OpenEars recognition, so I guess that&#8217;s not a viable solution.</p>
<p>Below is the log from the audio setup part, thought you&#8217;d be interested to see it:</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is a known limitation, if you&#8217;d like to read more about it the search keywords audio playback will probably show most of the previous discussions, and there is info in the FAQ.</p>
