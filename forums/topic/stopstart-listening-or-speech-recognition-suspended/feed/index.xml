						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was hoping you could nudge me in the right direction. </p>
<p>I would like to occasionally playback an MP3 in my app that may have voices talking, so I don&#8217;t want OpenEars to listen when the MP3 is playing and get confused. Consequently I&#8217;m calling stopListening when the MP3 starts and stopListening to happen when the MP3 is done playing.  Is this the appropriate approach, or is there a better way you would suggest?</p>
<p>Because the app starts to sporadically crash after I startListening again. I&#8217;m afraid that maybe I&#8217;m calling multiple pocketSphinxControllers on accident due to this method?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.<br />
-Dave</p>

						<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>suspendRecognition/resumeRecognition is what you&#8217;re looking for here. Crashes  shouldn&#8217;t be an issue in either case so there may be another underlying cause there.</p>

						<p>Ok.  I tried using the suspendRecognition but it didn&#8217;t seem to work..  I&#8217;ll poke around and try and figure out what is triggering it to resume before I say to.</p>

						<p>OK, it sounds a bit like there is something a little unusual about your implementation so it might be helpful to compare with the sample app, which has a suspend/resume implementation.</p>
