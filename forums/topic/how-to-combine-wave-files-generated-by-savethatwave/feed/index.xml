						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It seems OpenEars+SaveThatWave will record whatever used for the recognition, right? But it will generate a new wave file whenever there is a silence. Can SaveThatWave be configured to continue to save into one big wave file until [saveThatWaveController stop] is called? Or is there any way to combine those smaller wave files into one big wave file?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

						<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>The upcoming version of SaveThatWave does this &#8212; I&#8217;m just waiting to release it along with versions 1.65 of RapidEars and OpenEars which fix an annoying bug of long standing. I really hope to have them all out in a week or so.</p>
<p>The new SaveThatWave feature just has the caveat that it outputs what PocketsphinxController receives while listening is in progress, so when recognition is suspended there will be a period of silence of that length. Once listening has been stopped, it will produce and notify you of a complete WAV available to you, and if the session stops prematurely it will prepare the saved audio from that session into a WAV during the next session (it&#8217;s designed primarily as a tool to let you get a test output when you&#8217;re encountering issues).</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I got the new plugin and found a new method startSessionDebugRecord. I use this method to replace the place where I called start. But when can I get the wav file? After I call stop, I still couldn&#8217;t get the wav file.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

						<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Since the new feature captures the entire result of a listening session as the speech decoder hears it, the WAV is wrapped up and a notification is sent to you when the message [self.pocketsphinxController stopListening]; is sent.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>I called [self.saveThatWaveController startSessionDebugRecord] after calling [self.pocketsphinxController startListing] and called [self.pocketsphinxController stopListing] after speaking something. But I never got the indication for the wav file. Both device and simulator seem not working. Here is the message I got for simulator:</p>
