						<![CDATA[
						<p>I have 2 view controllers (VC1 and VC2) each of them uses OpenEars for TextToSpeach.<br />
I also implemented delegate &lt;OpenEarsEventsObserver&gt; to capture -(void)fliteDidStartSpeaking{}<br />
-(void)fliteDidFinishSpeaking{} events.</p>
<p>My problem: on VC1 everything works perfect, then I move on to VC2 and here when -(void)fliteDidStartSpeaking{} or -(void)fliteDidFinishSpeaking{} events occur it uses methods from the VC1 not the current VC2.</p>
<p>I tried nil-ing OpenEars object (cannot release in ARC) on VC1 before moving to VC2, app is crashing.</p>
<p>To make it work, I had to turn off ARC and manually release all OpenEars objects on VC1 before moving on to VC2.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make OpenEars use proper methods without turning ARC off?</p>
<p>Here is my VC1.h (that malfunctions with ARC on, to make it work: ARC=off in project build settings and release OpenEars objects in viewWillDisappear and alloc/init in viewWillAppear):</p>
<p>    #import &lt;Slt/Slt.h&gt;<br />
    #import &lt;OpenEars/FliteController.h&gt;<br />
    #import &lt;OpenEars/OpenEarsEventsObserver.h&gt;<br />
    @interface VC1: UIViewController&lt;OpenEarsEventsObserverDelegate&gt;{<br />
        FliteController *fliteController;<br />
        Slt *slt;<br />
        OpenEarsEventsObserver *openEarsEventsObserver;<br />
        }<br />
    @property (strong, nonatomic) FliteController *fliteController;<br />
    @property (strong, nonatomic) Slt *slt;<br />
    @property (strong, nonatomic) OpenEarsEventsObserver *openEarsEventsObserver;</p>
<p>VC1.m</p>
<p>    @synthesize fliteController,slt,openEarsEventsObserver;</p>
<p>    -(void)say_it{<br />
        [self.fliteController say:someTxt withVoice:self.slt];<br />
    }<br />
    -(void)stop_talking{<br />
        [self.fliteController interruptTalking];<br />
    }</p>
<p>    -(void)fliteDidStartSpeaking{<br />
        //do somthing when started speaking<br />
    }<br />
    -(void)fliteDidFinishSpeaking{<br />
        //do something when finished speaking<br />
    }<br />
    -(void)navToNextVC{//next view<br />
        UIViewController *nextVC= [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@&#8221;VC2&#8243;];<br />
        [self.navigationController pushViewController:nextVC animated:YES];<br />
    }<br />
    -(void)viewDidLoad{<br />
        fliteController = [[FliteController alloc] init];<br />
        slt = [[Slt alloc] init];<br />
        openEarsEventsObserver = [[OpenEarsEventsObserver alloc] init];<br />
        [openEarsEventsObserver setDelegate:self];<br />
    }</p>
<p>VC2.h amd .m is essentially the same, just different methods for fliteDidStart(Finished)Speaking.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Is the issue that only VC1 is getting callbacks, or is it possible that VC1 and VC2 are simultaneously getting callbacks from the same speech but you are reacting to the callback in VC1 first and not getting the info that VC2 is also getting the callback? The expectation is that they would both get a callback from the same speech event if they are both instantiated with OpenEarsEventsObserver delegates.</p>
<p>Second question is about what is being set to nil. Did you set FliteController to nil, FliteController&#8217;s OpenEarsEventsObserver, or FliteController&#8217;s OpenEarsEventsObserver.delegate?</p>

						<p>you are right, they both are called back, 1st on VC2 then on VC1.<br />
1st I tried nil-ing everything i.e. fliteController,slt,openEarsEventsObserver.delegate,openEarsEventsObserver then just openEarsEventsObserver.delegate in both cases app crashes.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>It should only be necessary to set the delegate of OpenEarsEventsObserver to nil â€“ can you just do that and show the logging output and the backtrace for the crash? To get the backtrace you&#8217;ll type &#8220;bt&#8221; when the app suspends due to the crash and you have the lldb prompt. It&#8217;s surprising that it crashes without a set delegate (versus the crash originating from something else) since the delegate methods are optional.</p>

						<p>OK. It&#8217;s actually working as designed that both view controllers get the events if they are both instantiated and have self as delegates. We can troubleshoot why you can&#8217;t make the first view controller no longer a delegate of the object.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>That looks more like it&#8217;s crashing because you aren&#8217;t using the recommended memory management from the sample app and tutorial. Can you switch over to that instead? Take a look at how FliteController is set up in the sample app and then only called as a property with self.fliteController. It&#8217;s also demonstrated step-by-step in the tutorial.</p>
