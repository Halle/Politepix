						<p>I am successfully integrated OpenEars framework an hour ago, but know I wanted to test the voice recognition and it doesn&#8217;t work. I set up a very minimalistic view controller to test it in my app, but it always crashes when some voice is detected.</p>
<p>It crashes in ps_start_utt in 0x80df2. I have logging enabled and receive following output: <a href="https://www.sourcedrop.net/WPg4e3069b5b0" rel="nofollow">https://www.sourcedrop.net/WPg4e3069b5b0</a></p>
<p>The source of the view controller is just some copy&amp;paste from the sample app. <a href="https://www.sourcedrop.net/bsB4e270527f7" rel="nofollow">https://www.sourcedrop.net/bsB4e270527f7</a></p>
<p>Does it matter that my application is a music player and changes the AVAudioSession on launch? <code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions<br />
{<br />
    NSError *audioSessionError = nil;<br />
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback error:&amp;audioSessionError];<br />
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES error:&amp;audioSessionError];<br />
    if (audioSessionError != nil) {<br />
        NSLog(@"Something went wrong with initialising the audio session!");<br />
    }</p>
<p>    AudioSessionSetActive(true);<br />
    AudioSessionAddPropertyListener(kAudioSessionProperty_AudioRouteChange, ARAudioSessionPropertyListener, nil);</p>
<p>    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];<br />
    // Override point for customization after application launch.<br />
    if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom] == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone) {<br />
        self.viewController = [[ARViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ARViewController_iPhone" bundle:nil];<br />
    } else {<br />
        self.viewController = [[ARViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ARViewController_iPad" bundle:nil];<br />
    }<br />
    self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;<br />
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];</p>
<p>    [OpenEarsLogging startOpenEarsLogging];<br />
    return YES;<br />
}</code></p>

						<p>To find out why PocketsphinxController is crashing, set verbosePocketSphinx to true. It probably can&#8217;t find all or part of the acoustic model or the language model in your new app.</p>

						<p>I already had [OpenEarsLogging startOpenEarsLogging];</p>
<p>And setting verbosePocketSphinx doesn&#8217;t change anything. Just Listening and then crashes.</p>
<p>Acoustic model and language model is generated dynamically, so this shouldn&#8217;t be missing.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>OpenEarsLogging and verbosePocketSphinx aren&#8217;t related. OpenEarsLogging logs the basic functionality of the audio driver etc, and verbosePocketSphinx logs what is going on under the surface for pocketsphinx, which is where your issue is. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible that you won&#8217;t get any new logging output when you turn on verbosePocketSphinx since the crash is occurring after pocketsphinx is starting. Please double-check that it is turned on so you can show your logs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Acoustic model and language model is generated dynamically, so this shouldnâ€™t be missing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The language model can be generated dynamically, but the acoustic model is part of the &#8220;framework&#8221; folder that has to be dragged into an app and cannot be dynamically generated. My guess is that the acoustic model isn&#8217;t in your new app.</p>

						<p>Oh, I mixed it up with the grammar model. All I have in my resources is: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0b3m3C2L0q37" rel="nofollow">http://cl.ly/image/0b3m3C2L0q37</a> (which is just the whole framework folder)</p>

						<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter anymore. After your last comment, I found out, that the framework folder must be included in flat form (using groups instead of folder references). Not it works.</p>
<p>Thanks for the support.</p>
