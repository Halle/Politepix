						<p>Hi,<br />
I have logging turned on in both VC&#8217;s. I have these two lines of code in both VC&#8217;s<br />
 [OELogging startOpenEarsLogging];<br />
 self.pocketsphinxController.verbosePocketSphinx = TRUE;<br />
It is now running on an iphone 6 with ios 8.1.1</p>
<p>I assume that&#8217;s what I need.Please let me know if that&#8217;s wrong. I need to include something else</p>
<p>So, I have Two VC&#8217;s in the same app and they both use open ears. Whichever one I run first runs fine The second one does not find any words in it&#8217;s dictionary.</p>
<p>For what&#8217;s it&#8217;s worth this ran beautifully in version 1.0 so maybe that&#8217;s a clue to help fix it for 2.0</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the log from the app running on the phone. Please let me know it you need anything else. This is all one app running. I have not edited the log<br />
Thanks.</p>
<p>I this case the firs VC has a dictionary of ten digits &#8211; ZERO thru NINE. I notice that the logger lists the dictionary with extra items ie ZERO (2).<br />
The second VC uses a dictionary with four colors.  The logger does not print out the second dictionary and it appears that the second VC might be trying to use the first dictionary???</p>

						<p>Can you check out the upgrade guide at <a href="/upgradeguide">/upgradeguide</a> and read the part about calling OEPocketsphinxController setActive: before setting OEPocketsphinxController properties? Your call to verbosePocketsphinx isn&#8217;t taking effect and that is likely to be the reason for it. Here is what verbosePocketsphinx output looks like:</p>

<p>It has all of the engine settings in it like this:</p>
<pre>
-bestpath	yes	yes
-bestpathlw	9.5	9.500000e+00
-bghist	no	no
-ceplen	13	13
</pre>

						<p>Hi Halle,<br />
I think I&#8217;ve got it going now. I&#8217;m properly initializing and both VC&#8217;s are working.<br />
One other question. I notice in the logs that is shows one of my dictionaries (the one with numbers with multiple entries. See the the log below. the other dictionary with four colors show up correctly. this doesn&#8217;t seem to impact the app, but i don&#8217;t know why it does it and i&#8217;m wondering if it might cause a problem further on.<br />
Here&#8217;s how I set up both arrays and you can see the logs below.<br />
Thanks for all of your help. I greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>NSArray *firstLanguageArray = @[@&#8221;ZERO&#8221;,<br />

						<p>Good to hear it. Something like this:</p>
<p>ZERO<br />
ZERO(2)</p>
<p>Just means that the dictionary has multiple pronunciations for some words. Some people say ZEE-ROH and some say ZEH-ROH so the (2) represents an alternate pronunciation which will be successfully heard by your app. If you open up your .dic file in a text editor, you can see the specific pronunciations if you are curious.</p>
