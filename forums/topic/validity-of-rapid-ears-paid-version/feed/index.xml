<p>Like all paid software, there is the possibility of major future updates which might be paid rather than free. So far there have not been any paid updates for the products.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the variation in price dependent only on the email support you will be providing or is there any other kind of support or things you will be providing me with higher paid version of RapidEars and other paid plugins.</p></blockquote>
<p>The price variations are for the number of email support cases and there is no other difference. The terms of purchase are documented in the shop page for RapidEars and the terms and conditions: <a href="/termsandconditions">/termsandconditions</a></p>
