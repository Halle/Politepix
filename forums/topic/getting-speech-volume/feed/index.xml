						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was wondering if there&#8217;s a way to get the speech volume. What I mean is a measurement of how loud the user spoke (was he speaking, speaking louder, or shouting?).</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You can get the incoming speech power using the result of the method pocketsphinxInputLevel (you have to listen to this value on a background thread since it will block the main thread if you don&#8217;t &#8212; there is an example of doing this in the sample app). Knowing what this power level means in terms of speaking/loud speaking/shouting is a subjective interpretation, so deciding what different power levels mean in those terms is an implementation detail for your app.</p>

						<p>Thanks :-)<br />
Will definitely check it out.<br />
is there a mix-max values to this parameter?</p>

						<p>Not as such &#8212; it attempts to approximate the negative decibel offset range that an AudioQueue can return, but it doesn&#8217;t guarantee it. The range should be a float that goes from some negative value (something like -74) up to zero, where zero is the maximum.</p>

						<p>@Halle &#8211; in the example it&#8217;s running from an NSTimer &#8211; doesn&#8217;t this mean it&#8217;s running on the main runloop?<br />
If not &#8211; does running this check on a background thread mean I might not have a very accurate impression of how loudly a particular word is being said?</p>
<p>I was hoping to be able to use a high-pass filter to figure out if someone was speaking loudly on a certain word.</p>
<p>Thanks for making this library, I&#8217;m really enjoying playing with it.<br />
Cheers<br />
Liam</p>

						<p>Welcome Liam,</p>
<p>The example shown should give an accurate impression of the current volume within the normal latency offset.</p>

						<p>IMO the example as well as the volume API internals are both overdue for an update, but that aspect of the library is pretty road-tested at this point so I think that you can use it. But keep in mind that it isn&#8217;t an objective volume reading, it is relative to the constant used and not intended to give an exact decibel reading since it was designed for UI design.</p>

						<p>Understood, thanks Halle.</p>
<p>I think that if I check for volume each time a word is detected (regardless of a match), and use a high-pass filter I can detect for fluctuations in volume on a per-word basis. (I think)</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
