						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello, I have tried the TTS engine in openers, it works well. But I am wondering that Is it possible to pause a Synthesized speech and then restart it from the same place? Additionally, after I called [FliteController say:], could I access the progress state when it is speaking?(e.g. what sentence it is speaking)</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Sorry, you can&#8217;t pause and restart FliteController speech. The progress state is a new feature of NeatSpeech 1.5 that is about to be released.</p>
