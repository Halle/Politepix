						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it possible to play a pre-recorded sound before playing synthesized speech?<br />
This is what I&#8217;ve figured out so far.</p>
<p>I can create an OpenEarsEventsObserver object and set the delegate to object which implements.</p>
<p>&#8211; (void) fliteDidStartSpeaking; </p>
<p>However how do I used this callback method to insert/play pre recorded sound before synthesized speech.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&#8211;MB.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You can play a sound whenever you like using standard AVAudioPlayer methods and their delegates. Just initiate speech once the AVAudioPlayer delegate method audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successfully: returns.</p>

						<p>Thanks for the response.<br />
I want to play the sound before synthesized speech starts playing. Is that possible?  The &#8216;audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successfully:&#8217; would only allow audio to be inserted afterwards.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<blockquote><p>The ‘audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successfully:’ would only allow audio to be inserted afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only if you start playing the AVAudioPlayer sound after the speech returns the OpenEarsEventsObserver method. If you initiate the speech as a result of the audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successfully: method of a sound that you play using AVAudioPlayer being called, the sound will precede the speech.</p>
