						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to use one of your free extra voices for text to speech capability in my app.  My app was working fine with the Slt voice but when I try to add other voices such as Kal or Kal16 I get an error message:</p>
<p>ld: warning: ignoring file /Volumes/EXTERNAL/Developer/WebSpeak/Awb.framework/Awb, missing required architecture x86_64 in file /Volumes/EXTERNAL/Developer/WebSpeak/Awb.framework/Awb (3 slices)<br />
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:<br />
  &#8220;_OBJC_CLASS_$_Awb&#8221;, referenced from:<br />
      objc-class-ref in ThirdViewController.o<br />
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64<br />
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</p>
<p>ld: warning: ignoring file /Volumes/EXTERNAL/Developer/WebSpeak/Awb.framework/Awb, missing required architecture x86_64 in file /Volumes/EXTERNAL/Developer/WebSpeak/Awb.framework/Awb (3 slices)</p>
<p>This makes me think that the extra voices aren&#8217;t x86 64 (64 bit) capable.  Is this correct?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Josh Meador</p>

						<p>Welcome Josh,</p>
<p>My recollection is that they have all been recompiled for 64-bit, not sure what the issue is there. x86_64 is actually just the 64-bit Simulator, not the 64-bit devices, so see if it runs correctly if you target a real device.</p>
