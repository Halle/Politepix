						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In the given sample code two OpenEars1.dic is used. I tried to change it to cmu07a.dic. But it is not recognizing words from cmu07a.dic, but it is taking words from OpenEars1.dic. Please let me know how can i make my own dictionary and use it in the sample app.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response. I am quite new for iOS. So please forgive me i am asking any silly questions. I have read the tutorial. According to that i have to change path for the dictionary. I did that. But it is not recognizing the correct word. It is recognizing the same words as there were in openears1.dic</p>

						<p>Hi Priya,</p>
<p>OK, not a problem. The vocabulary is not defined by use of a dictionary file or by changing the path to a dictionary file. The only information inside a dictionary file is how the words are pronounced, which is only half of the required information that PocketsphinxController needs in order to use a specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>Instead a vocabulary is created dynamically by giving an NSArray of words or phrase to the generateLanguageModelFromArray:withFilesNamed: method of LanguageModelGenerator. These output a matched pair of a language model and a dictionary, both of which must be used together and in the specific format output by LanguageModelGenerator. You can see exactly how if you go to the tutorial, select &#8220;Offline Speech Recognition&#8221;, and exactly follow the instructions under &#8220;Using LanguageModelGenerator&#8221;.</p>
<p>The second issue is that in offline recognition, your vocabulary will only be accurately perceived if it is between 1-500 words (approximately; actual results will vary and I have seen accurate models around 1000 words and less-accurate models that were very small but consisted of very similar-sounding one-syllable words or words that are very uncommon in English.). So cmu07a.dic is not possible to use with OpenEars because it has about 80,000 words.</p>
