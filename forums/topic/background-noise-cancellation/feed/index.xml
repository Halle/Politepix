						<p>Does one of the plugins doing background noise cancellation? I did some tests of names from my contact list which worked great in a quiet room. In a moving car, I did the same test and the accuracy was not very good.</p>

						<p>This is awesome news! </p>
<p>I downloaded openears from <a href="/openears/">/openears/</a>  and tried running the OpenEarsSampleApp. </p>
<p>I ran into some compile errors, which I attempted to fix by changing the framework search paths (which references Users/me/&#8230;) to ../Framework but then got an error saying </p>
<p>ld: framework not found OpenEars</p>
<p>which I&#8217;m not sure how to fix.</p>

						<p>Sorry about that â€“ one of Xcode&#8217;s little pranks, I&#8217;ve restored the relative paths. Can you download a new version, give it another try and see if this one builds?</p>

						<p>BTW, you may need to adjust OEPocketsphinxController&#8217;s new vadThreshold property a bit up or down to get the desired speech/silence threshold with the new noise-robust voice activity detection. The current setting is what my testing showed to be in the right neighborhood, but you can change it to match your use case better if it isn&#8217;t exactly right. If it is too low it can react to too much environmental noise, and if it is too high it can exclude intentional speech.</p>

						<p>hmm, I just re-downloaded and still am getting a compile issue (below) .  Not sure why since I see OpenEars is clearly in the Framework search paths. thoughts? out of curiosity, have you updated to xcode 6.1.1? maybe that is why it&#8217;s working for you and not me?</p>

						<p>Sorry, it looks like the needed link in the framework to resources was accidentally added to my .gitignore so the uploaded version was missing an essential file (but could be found on my local filesystem). I&#8217;ve fixed it and created a virtual machine with a user who has none of my local file structure so I can check whether this is an issue in the future.</p>
<p>The current uploaded version worked fine for my test developer, so I think it should work fine for you. Please re-download and make sure you&#8217;ve deleted the previous two downloads to be sure there&#8217;s no unintentional interaction or caching before running the sample app with the new version. Thanks for hanging in there.</p>
