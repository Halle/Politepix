						<p>Say the program is listening to a phrase &#8220;This is cool&#8221;. In addition to recognizing that the phrase &#8220;This is cool&#8221; was spoken,  I also want to know that the word &#8220;cool&#8221; was spoken 2.32 seconds into &#8220;This is cool&#8221;. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot for any help. </p>
