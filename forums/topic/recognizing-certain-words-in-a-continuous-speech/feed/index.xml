						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m integrating my iOS app with the offline voice recognition functionality, and I wonder if it is possible to recognize some, let&#8217;s say, key words while the user is in a conversation, or in the middle of a complete sentence. I mean: for example, I&#8217;d like to recognize the word &#8220;HELLO&#8221; in a phrase or sentence &#8220;* HELLO *&#8221;, being * whatever the user is saying. I&#8217;m only able to detect isolated words between silences, is it possible to do what I&#8217;d like to do with this SDK? Could somebody help me to solve this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This is basically what Rejecto is for: <a href="/rejecto">/rejecto</a>. It allows words which aren&#8217;t in the vocabulary to be ignored in a recognition pass so that you can do keyword spotting.</p>
