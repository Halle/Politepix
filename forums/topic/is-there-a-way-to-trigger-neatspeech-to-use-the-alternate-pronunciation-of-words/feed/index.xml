						<p>e.g.: &#8220;read&#8221; is always spoken as &#8220;red&#8221;, a more extreme example being &#8220;trial&#8221; is always spoken as &#8220;try-uhl&#8221; even when it&#8217;s the suffix of a word and should be &#8220;tree-uhl&#8221;.</p>

						<p>Hmm, although a lot of work went into this for 1.5, there isn&#8217;t an objective fix for it. It&#8217;s a difficult question in speech in general because it involves successfully tagging a part of speech and the variation thereof, which is usually going to be a 90%-accurate thing even when it&#8217;s going well. I can recommend two workarounds for you:</p>
<p>1. You can try editing the problem entries in NeatSpeechRequired.bundle/lib/dicts/cmu/cmudict-0.4.out and see if that is the entry being used in that case, for instance this one:</p>
<p>(&#8220;read&#8221; nil (((r eh d) 1)))</p>
<p>can be changed to </p>
<p>(&#8220;read&#8221; nil (((r iy d) 1)))</p>
<p>2. Cheat. If you want it to sound like &#8220;reed&#8221;, use &#8220;reed&#8221;. If you want the suffix form of trial, use &#8220;tree all&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a related note, are there any scientific or medical dictionaries for NeatSpeech? Where would I find documentation on custom or alternate dictionaries?</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no documentation for this because NeatSpeech is currently limited to its built-in methodology for finding pronunciations. However, I think you could probably add pronunciations for jargon directly to NeatSpeechRequired.bundle/lib/dicts/cmu/cmudict-0.4.out if you can observe its formatting method. My method is just to find the phonemes (the short pronunciation elements) by looking up a rhyming word from the same dictionary, so if I needed to add &#8220;Endometrial&#8221; my steps would be as follows:</p>
<p>• Find the phonemes by looking up its syllable components &#8220;end&#8221;, &#8220;oh&#8221;, &#8220;me&#8221;, &#8220;tree&#8221; and &#8220;all&#8221; in the same dictionary.<br />
* Observe that in this dictionary a syllable is written as follows, with the phonemes in the syllable in parentheses followed by a 1 for a stressed syllable and followed by a 0 for an unstressed syllable: ((eh n d) 1)<br />
• Observe that the entire set of syllables is enclosed in parentheses<br />
• Observe that the final parentheses surround the initial string which is the word in lowercase inside quotes followed by nil plus the enclosed syllables.<br />
• Make sure that I put my final entry in the correct alphabetical position in the dictionary. My entry looks like this: (&#8220;endometrial&#8221; nil (((eh n d) 0) ((ow) 0) ((m iy) 1) ((t r iy) 0) ((ao l) 0)))</p>
