						<p>Hi. I&#8217;m new to OpenEars. I was wondering if there&#8217;s anything I can put in the string that will make flitecontroller pause when it says the text. What I&#8217;d like to do is put in longer pauses between sentences. I&#8217;d rather do this without stopping and restarting flitecontroller&#8230; meaning I&#8217;d like the string itself to make flitecontroller pause.</p>
<p>Thanks! OpenEars is fantastic.</p>

						<p>Hi I&#8217;m looking for the same functionality described above. I&#8217;d like to include a one second pause within a string passed to the say method. Is that possible currently?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>There is currently no way to insert a pause into a FliteController statement. Is there a reason not to do it as two separate statements?</p>
