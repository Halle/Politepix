						<![CDATA[
						<p>Using the code from the tutorial and OpenEars demo app everything is working great except I seem to get double commands inside of pocketsphinxDidReceiveHypothesis for the hypothesis sometimes even though I&#8217;m very carefully saying the command once. Actually, sometimes there are other words from my generated grammar and dictionary, like &#8220;RIGHT GO&#8221; or &#8220;LEFT GO STOP&#8221; when &#8220;GO&#8221; was spoken.</p>
<p>Tried<br />
[self.pocketSphinxController setSecondsOfSilenceToDetect:0.6];<br />
and then also<br />
[self.pocketSphinxController setNBestNumber:1];<br />
[self.pocketSphinxController setReturnNbest:YES];</p>
<p>other than cleaning the result up myself is there something I can tweak to get this only returning the best match and 1 result?</p>

						<p>No, testing through an iPad 3. And I noticed this time that after I get the extra words in hypothesis, if I try again it usually works and only returns the 1 word, &#8220;STOP&#8221; or &#8220;GO&#8221;. I am using the demo version which I just downloaded yesterday (probably obvious from my noob question here).</p>

						<p>Oh, another question &#8212; you posted this in the OpenEars plugins section, but from the info in the question I&#8217;ve been assuming that the question is actually about OpenEars without a plugin. Is this incorrect and the question is about one of the OpenEars plugins, or is it just about OpenEars itself?</p>

						<p>Ok, yes I thought I was using Rejecto but I was not yet using anything in that area.<br />
So I think this is just OpenEars.<br />
This happens after the first hypothesis. Once I got &#8220;STOP&#8221; &#8220;LEFT&#8221; &#8220;STOP&#8221; &#8220;GO&#8221; &#8220;STOP&#8221; from just saying &#8220;STOP&#8221; once</p>
<p>Anything wrong with the way the grammar and dictionary are setup?<br />
	NSArray *words = @[@&#8221;LEFT&#8221;,@&#8221;RIGHT&#8221;,@&#8221;GO&#8221;,@&#8221;STOP&#8221;,@&#8221;FINISH&#8221;,@&#8221;KILL&#8221;];<br />
	NSString *name = @&#8221;commandLanguageModelFile.languagemodel&#8221;;<br />
	NSError *error = [lmGenerator generateLanguageModelFromArray:words withFilesNamed:name];</p>
<p>	NSDictionary *languageGeneratorResults = nil;</p>
<p>	if ([error code] == noErr)<br />
	{<br />
		languageGeneratorResults = [error userInfo];<br />
		self.pathToDynamicallyGeneratedGrammar = [languageGeneratorResults objectForKey:@&#8221;LMPath&#8221;];<br />
		self.pathToDynamicallyGeneratedDictionary = [languageGeneratorResults objectForKey:@&#8221;DictionaryPath&#8221;];</p>
<p>		[self startListening];<br />
	}<br />
	else<br />
	{<br />
		NSLog(@&#8221;Error: %@&#8221;,[error localizedDescription]);<br />
	}</p>

						<p>OK, that sounds a bit buggy. It&#8217;s possibly an iPad 3 issue with the cmninit value that we could probably fix right now.  Your code looks reasonable to me. </p>
<p>Can I ask you to turn on verbosePocketsphinx and verboseLanguageModelGenerator and OpenEarsLogging and then print the log here? I&#8217;d like to see a log for 5 recognition rounds and it would be great if you would separately tell me what you really said.</p>

						<p>Ok, will do this evening or tomorrow morning. I am using the built-in mic at the top of the iPad. Also one thing I found by going through the official demo code was that after making the call below it worked perfectly. So I plugged that into my demo code just to see and it also worked perfectly every time.</p>

						<p>That&#8217;s funny, thanks for letting me know. It&#8217;s a big hint about what the underlying issue might be and I&#8217;m glad you have a workaround for now. When you get the time to send me the full log output I will see if I can track down the issue.</p>
