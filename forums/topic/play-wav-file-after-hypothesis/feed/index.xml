						<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Is there any method that can allow OpenEars, after recognition<br />
, playing a wav/mp3 file after hypothesis?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This is outside of OpenEars&#8217; API since it isn&#8217;t intended to be a general-purpose audio toolkit, but you can just play back a WAV using AVAudioPlayer after receiving a hypothesis. </p>

						<p>Sorry, I need another help.</p>
<p>The situation is that, I want to produce different mp3 sound for each recognition.</p>
<p>Example is that:</p>
<p>When pocketsplinx receive hypothesis A, after recognition, it will play<br />
A.mp3</p>
<p>When pocketsplinx receive hypothesis B, after recognition, it will play<br />
B.mp3</p>
<p>How can I modify the source code to let such happen?</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>It&#8217;s the same answer as my first answer above. OpenEars doesn&#8217;t play audio files, so you don&#8217;t have to modify OpenEars&#8217; source code in order to do that. You will put the logic for playing audio files in your own app code, and you can use OpenEars&#8217; API to decide when to trigger that code in your app.</p>

<p>Can you explain this with more detail?<br />
Since I am quite confusing about this.</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry, that is getting into more general questions about how to use Objective-C to develop apps. As much as I wish I could assist with those more general questions, I only have the resources to offer help with OpenEars here.</p>
