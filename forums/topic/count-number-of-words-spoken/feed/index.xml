						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are looking to create an iPhone app that simply counts the number of words spoken from an audio stream. For example, user hits &#8220;start recording&#8221;, says a sentence like &#8220;Hi, I am Mike&#8221; and then hits &#8220;stop recording&#8221;. The output would be 4 words. We don&#8217;t care about what words specifically are spoken, just the number. Is this possible with OpenEars? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This would be possible to do if the words were identifiable (i.e. you knew them in advance). Without knowing the words which are spoken, you can&#8217;t really count number of words, because you don&#8217;t know what comprises a word versus some arbitrary combination of syllables.</p>

						<p>Thanks for the quick response! </p>
<p>Two thoughts:</p>
<p>Is there any functionality to measure syllable nuclei:<br />

<p>OR</p>
<p>Can you simply do a speech-to-text and then just do a total count on all of the words?</p>

<p>No, but this wouldn&#8217;t tell you how many words the user had said, just how many syllables. You can currently get an middling-good attempt at phoneme transcription out of Rejecto, but again, knowing parts of words doesn&#8217;t tell you anything about how many words were said unless you already know the words, in which case you should just create a language model or grammar using those words and then count utterances of them directly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you simply do a speech-to-text and then just do a total count on all of the words?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think I would do it this way using a custom language model, but it would require knowing the needed vocabulary in advance.</p>
