						<p>Also, I do not have in &#8220;listening&#8221; stuff in the project.<br />
I just want Text to speech. I think the standard openears works ok<br />
with just text to speech but Neatspeech does not, Can you check this out<br />
and tell me how I just do text to speech with Neatspeech.</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This happens if you&#8217;ve missed a step in the installation from the tutorial and documentation where you add the -ObjC linker flag to your target. Just take a second look at the tutorial for adding NeatSpeech and give some extra attention to the step &#8220;Preparing to use Plugins&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>
and all I can get is this belowâ€¦ iOS 6 WHAT iS the DEAL???
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer to avoid this kind of tone here. It&#8217;s normal in programming projects that even experienced developers make minor mistakes in the process of getting a piece of software working &#8212; it could be me overlooking a step when releasing a plugin or it could be you innocently missing a step in the tutorial &#8212; so it&#8217;s much better for everyone to keep things constructive. I have removed your second post saying the same thing and changed your username to something that will have less of a likelihood of causing confusion.</p>
