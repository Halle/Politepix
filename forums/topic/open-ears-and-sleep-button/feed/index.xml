						<p>Will open ears still operate after person has hit the sleep button?</p>
<p>Lets say I press the sleep button on my Iphone so that I can place it in my pocket without worry of pocket dialing someone; but I want open ears to still be able to recognize my voice and respond, is this possible?</p>

						<p>I don&#8217;t know offhand so I&#8217;d just recommend trying it on the sample app, but the answer is most likely no for the reasons explained in this StackOverflow question:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8198220/nstimer-events-do-no-occur-when-screen-locked-on-ios-5" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8198220/nstimer-events-do-no-occur-when-screen-locked-on-ios-5</a></p>
<p>Without being able to react to events, it&#8217;s unlikely that a speech recognition engine is going to do much.</p>

						<p>Halle,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response and link!<br />
This is crazy that apple won&#8217;t allow apps to run once the screen has been locked! There must be a way around this&#8230; I&#8217;ll keep looking&#8230;</p>

						<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t run, it&#8217;s that they cut down on notifications and timer processes to save battery. I think it&#8217;s probably more about enduser expectations about what happens when they press the lock button than Apple being controlling, since pocket dialing is probably not a big worry due to the touch interface.</p>
