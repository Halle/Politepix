						<p>I am using RapidEars and Rejecto demo plugins in OpenEars demo app. If I use phrases that have word with apostrophes (e.g. contractions), it appears as if those words are not &#8220;recognizable&#8221; when I run the app. For example:<code></code></p>
<pre><code>
languageArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithArray:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:
@&quot;HE&#039;S OVER THERE&quot;,
@&quot;IT&#039;S OVER THERE&quot;,
@&quot;HE&#039;S IN THE CHAIR&quot;,
@&quot;HE&#039;S IN A CHAIR&quot;,
nil]];</code></pre>
<p>I can&#8217;t get He&#8217;s or It&#8217;s to be recognized at all. If I use &#8220;He is&#8221; or &#8220;It is&#8221; instead, then it works reasonably well.</p>
<p>I looked at the dynamic dictionary that&#8217;s created by Rejecto and the words in the dictionary are entered without apostrophe (e..g HES and ITS).</p>
<p>Not sure what&#8217;s the best way to convert DMP file to text file and check what&#8217;s going on with the grammar.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea why this may be happening and if there is a special way words with apostrophes should be specified (I tried escaping apostrophe, but that didn&#8217;t help).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ogi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<p>This might be an issue with excessive string sanitization on my part. I&#8217;ve entered a issue to check out on this and hope to get a chance to investigate in the next couple of weeks.</p>

						<p>I can also confirm I have experienced this.  When would you estimate you could get a fix released?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
