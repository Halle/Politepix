						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly right â€“ you need to wait until you get the callback in fliteDidFinishSpeaking in order to know one line of speech is complete, before you can begin the next one.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle Thanks for your kind response. But some people said we should not write code (that to fetch next text and call &#8220;say&#8221; in flitedidfinishsieaking because it is delegated callback ? </p>

						<p>You can naturally use the callback in order to call a method responsible for advancing your speech utterances through a queue or any business logic that you prefer for that. I guess I don&#8217;t really understand the idea of avoiding using the callback in order to trigger an event based on the information shared by the callback about the status of an asynchronous API. If that were dangerous, it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to react to the status of any of Apple&#8217;s async APIs which deliver status information through delegates (for example audio playback or networking APIs).</p>
