						<p>We have an App that can listen in the background, but it only works if we start listening while the App is in the foreground, and then switch to the background, and we can see the red bar at the top.</p>
<p>But when we try to start listening while already in the background, we encounter an exception. Below is the logging output:</p>
<p>Recognition loop has started<br />
Starting openAudioDevice on the device.<br />
Audio unit wrapper successfully created.<br />
12:27:41.633 &lt;0x4d89000&gt; AURemoteIO::Initialize failed: -12985 (enable 3, outf&lt; 1 ch,  16000 Hz, Int16&gt; inf&lt; 1 ch,  16000 Hz, Int16&gt;)<br />
Couldn&#8217;t initialize audio unit: -12985<br />
openAudioDevice failed</p>
<p>We have set our App to use the background mode plays audio, so that&#8217;s why it works in the first scenario. Any thoughts on why we have trouble starting in the background?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Hmm, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible to start up remoteio audio recording while in the background. My understanding is that the background mode can background a recording that is already in process but not start one. Have you encountered other examples in which this works?</p>

						<p>Hi Pooja, </p>
<p>This question is unlikely to get an answer because it requests a very large amount of work from the other party &#8212; you are basically requesting a complete tutorial. The other longer thread in which you asked this question has all the info needed in order to answer your question, please give it another read-through and try out some or all of the suggestions in it.</p>
