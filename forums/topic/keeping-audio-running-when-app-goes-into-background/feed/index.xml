						<p>Hi. I&#8217;m trying to keep flite speaking when the app goes into the background. Right now the audio stops. In my info.plist, I&#8217;ve included audio as one of the required background modes.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I need to do?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

						<p>Hmmm&#8230; in that thread, you mentioned keeping the current audio stream running, even if you can&#8217;t initiate a new stream. In my app, the current audio stream stops quickly after hitting the home button. Is there a way to allow the current stream to continue?</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m surprised to hear that it&#8217;s possible and in the thread it&#8217;s actually the other developer who has a method, so I can&#8217;t really help with implementing his approach unfortunately.</p>

						<p>Just to update, I got it working. The reason it wasn&#8217;t working before was that I was editing the wrong info.plist (i was accidentally editing the test-info.plist file instead).</p>
<p>Setting audio as one of the required background modes looks like all that needs to be done. very nice.</p>
