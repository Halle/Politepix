						<![CDATA[
						<p>How can I use Openears to say Phonemes?</p>
<p>I would like to build an app that reads out single pre-programmed words, coded in phonemes.<br />
I think the current TTS isn&#8217;t always accurate and sometimes hard to understand unless the word is in a sentence, so I would like to use phonemes instead.</p>
<p>I see fliteController doesn&#8217;t have many methods other than really &#8216;say&#8217;, however, I did come across this thread: <a href="/forums/topic/using-flite-to-pronounce-a-word-a-certain-way/">here</a> and mentions:<br />
<i>float flite_phones_to_speech(const char *text, cst_voice *voice, const char *outtype)</i><br />
which appears to me to be in C++ (or similar). How do I access this function/method in Objective-C?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

						<p>Yup, it&#8217;s the second-worst voice out of eight. I think it would be a good use of time to brush up on the documentation about the different voices and try the better ones first.</p>

						<p>I must be missing something then. I&#8217;d tried all of them, and I preferred this one.</p>
<p>How do I just say phonemes? is this possible? is it in the documentation (please point me in the right direction &#8211; Thanks!!!!).</p>

						<p>OK, but this is a standard complaint about the KAL voices and one I&#8217;ve rarely heard about the higher-quality 16-bit voices:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the current TTS isnâ€™t always accurate and sometimes hard to understand unless the word is in a sentence</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no OpenEars function to just say phonemes. If you&#8217;re handy with C and want to read up on the Flite public API, you can change FliteController&#8217;s implementation of Flite to accept an input of phonemes instead of words and use Flite&#8217;s flite_synth_phones function on a returned CST utterance that then needs to be turned into a CST wave, and recompile the framework to give your app access to the changed method. It&#8217;s possible but the steps involved are unfortunately outside of the support scope of this forum.</p>

						<p>Thx Halle, I&#8217;ve updated to 1.2 and gone back to SLT voices, but still trying to get phonemes to work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve ended up created my own flite_phones_to_wave function (essentially copying flite_text_to_wave and replacing the reference of flite_synth_text with flite_synth_phones). However I&#8217;m still have dramas.<br />
Do you know the format of the phonemes for the parameter in flite_synth_phones function? I can&#8217;t seem to find any documentation for this. Cheers.</p>

						<p>Hi, sorry for the fact that I didn&#8217;t see this.Here is a function I use in grapheme generator to obtain phones for arbitrary text:</p>
<p>const char * flite_text_to_phones(const char *text,<br />
								  cst_voice *voice,<br />
								  const char *outtype)<br />
{<br />
    const char * phones;</p>
<p>	cst_utterance *u;</p>
<p>    u = flite_synth_text(text,voice);<br />
	flite_process_output(u,outtype,FALSE);<br />
	phones = print_phones(u);</p>
<p>    delete_utterance(u);</p>
<p>    return phones;<br />
}</p>
<p>But this of course involves two synthesis passes. I do it with a really fast voice in OpenEars so it isn&#8217;t that arduous but it&#8217;s probably still noticeable.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, the phonemes used in Flite are the same ones used in Pocketsphinx with the exception that Pocketphinx&#8217;s ah needs to be turned into ax.</p>

						<p>You can also just change the variance on the SLT voice to a very low value in order to get that zero-inflection phoneme effect.</p>

						<p>Thanks Halle!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really struggling here, more function are playing really weird sounds and don&#8217;t resemble anything close to actual speech.</p>
<p>I tried your function, thanks, but run into trouble because I don&#8217;t have the print_phones() function.</p>
<p>Finding the right documentation is proving to be a nightmare.</p>
<p>Do you know what format the &#8216;text&#8217; should be when passing to flite_synth_phones(text,voice)? All I manage to get is a jumbled miss of noise.</p>
