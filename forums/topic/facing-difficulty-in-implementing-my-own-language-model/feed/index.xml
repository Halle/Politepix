						<![CDATA[
						<p>I am trying to use openears for my app where I want to pass on some commands on voice and expect the app should perform them.I have put the check in hypothesis receive delegate method for all the events and actions.</p>
<p>I made a new language model of text file type and a dictionary that contain the words I require(my commands).I get no error when I pass that language model file (text file) using generate languageModel method. Then in startListening i give path of the language model.text file i created. sometimes application listen to my words but most of the time it listen and return ‘Right’ in hypothesis. Is there something wrong or am i missing any step. Please help.</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you show your code where you generate the language model and then pass it to startListening:? Alternately, the tutorial will show how to generate a new language model: <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a></p>
