						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello</p>
<p>I only want to recognize one word at the time. Is there a way to limit recognition length to one word?</p>
<p>I am thinking of setting a timer in pocketsphinxDidDetectSpeech for 1 second and invalidate the timer in pocketsphinxDidDetectFinishedSpeech. And if the timer fires, call suspendRecognition and then resumeRecognition in order to cancel the recognition after 1 sec.</p>
<p>Would this be ok?</p>
<p>I am also testing to set a very low secondsOfSilenceToDetect</p>

						<p>I don&#8217;t think the timer will get good results, people speak at different speeds and words have different lengths. How about  ignoring anything after the first space in the hypothesis?</p>

						<p>My words are short.</p>
<p>I do not want to keep feeding speech into the recognizer. If the speaker talks a long time without silence, will it affect memory consumption, buffer sizes?</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>I haven&#8217;t profiled yet I&#8217;m just assuming. It seems unnecessary to keep on recognizing when one already knows, in my case, that it won&#8217;t be a match.</p>
<p>Is there a hardcoded maximum length of continuos speech limit? In that case maybe decrease this value.</p>
