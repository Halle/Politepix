						<p>When using OpenEars the sound playback quality gets reduced. Is there a way to prevent the AVAudioSession reconfiguring when using the PocketsphinxController the first time?</p>

						<p>Can you describe the reduction more specifically? It shouldn&#8217;t be possible for the bitrate or sample rate to be changed so I&#8217;m unclear on what aspect of playback is different. You can&#8217;t use PocketsphinxController without the audio session settings it needs.</p>

						<p>What I&#8217;ve found out when using logging is:<br />
<code>2012-09-05 12:13:51.599 Autoradio[5729:707] preferredBufferSize is incorrect, we will change it.<br />
2012-09-05 12:13:51.604 Autoradio[5729:707] PreferredBufferSize is now on the correct setting of 0.128000.<br />
2012-09-05 12:13:51.609 Autoradio[5729:707] preferredSampleRateCheck is incorrect, we will change it.<br />
2012-09-05 12:13:51.698 Autoradio[5729:707] preferred hardware sample rate is now on the correct setting of 16000.000000.</code></p>
<p>May this result in reduction?<br />
It&#8217;s hard to describe, maybe because I am not a musician. I would say everything sounds more dull. Thought of a lowering of the bitrate?</p>

						<p>I extended the logging a bit and recompiled the lib. That&#8217;s what I am getting:<br />
<code>2012-09-05 12:29:57.733 Autoradio[5778:707] preferredBufferSize is incorrect, we will change it. Current value: 0.023000<br />
2012-09-05 12:29:57.747 Autoradio[5778:707] PreferredBufferSize is now on the correct setting of 0.128000.<br />
2012-09-05 12:29:57.755 Autoradio[5778:707] preferredSampleRateCheck is incorrect, we will change it. Current value: 44100.000000<br />
2012-09-05 12:29:57.945 Autoradio[5778:707] preferred hardware sample rate is now on the correct setting of 16000.000000.</code><br />
Sounds like a reduction of hardware sample rate? May I am able to change the check to something like if it is the prefereded kSamplesPerSecond or better or will this block the functionality of OpenEars?</p>

						<p>Changed it to:<br />
<code>if (fabs(preferredSampleRateCheck - kSamplesPerSecond)  0.0) {</code> in AudioSessionManager.m:400 and it still works and the reduction doesn&#8217;t take place anymore.</p>

						<p>Ah, I understand now, you&#8217;re using a full 44.1k rate and PocketsphinxController requires (really requires) a 16k rate. If you convince it not to sample at 16k you will reduce the recognition accuracy severely. You&#8217;re correct that 16k recordings won&#8217;t sound as nice as 44.1k (CD quality) but if Pocketsphinx analyzed a 44.1k recording it would take forever.</p>

						<p>Something is wrong with the code tag in this forum so I uploaded the change to line 400 in AudioSessionManager.m here: <a href="https://www.sourcedrop.net/Tyj72cb2147c9" rel="nofollow">https://www.sourcedrop.net/Tyj72cb2147c9</a></p>
<p>Will this have an influence on OpenEars?</p>
