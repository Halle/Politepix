						<p>Halle,</p>
<p>We&#8217;re using RapidEars/Rejecto/OpenEars to do live speech recognition on prepared text a user is reading. We&#8217;ve got it working fine for 4-5 minute long speeches, however we&#8217;ve noticed that after some time of speaking (anywhere between 6-15 minutes users have reported) OpenEars stops working and a whole bunch oe_assertions() start to fail like these:</p>
<p>failed oe_assertion `hmm_frame(&amp;hmm_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart-&gt;hmm_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart) &gt;= frame_idx_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart’<br />
failed oe_assertion `hmm_frame(&amp;hmm_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart-&gt;hmm_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart) == frame_idx_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart’<br />
failed oe_assertion `frame_idx_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart == bpe.frame_re_combelleautechnologiespromptsmart’</p>
<p>One thing I suspect might be the culprit is that whenever these assertions start to fail, the hypothesis being delivered to our rapidEars recognition delegate is very long (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qdz2lqkln0tere/hypothesis?dl=0" title="Hypothesis of 900 words" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a>) . </p>
<p>I noticed that it happens more often when there are no pauses in the speech (which I guess explains why the hypothesis is so long). </p>
<p>i.) Any idea what might be causing the assertions to start to fail?</p>
<p>ii.) Are there options on rapidears or openears to tell it to not continue to generate such a long hypothesis in the absence of pauses by the speaker?</p>

						<p>Yes, there are some practical limits to how long a single hypothesis can be for live recognition in RapidEars – an unbounded hypothesis length in live recognition wasn&#8217;t a design goal and isn&#8217;t currently possible. I&#8217;m currently examining these issues for an upcoming version update, so if you&#8217;d like to send me a recording and a dictionary/language model pair that replicates the exceptions, I can add them to the testbed and see if a better result is possible in the next version.</p>
