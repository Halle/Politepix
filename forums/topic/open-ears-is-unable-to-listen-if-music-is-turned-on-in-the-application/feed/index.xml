						<p>Hi,<br />
Am so impressed by the way the open ears is working and the integration part has been made so easy than before.<br />
Currently am working on a iOS application which has music and navigation modules in it.<br />
When music is turned on and immediately turned off, and then i make PocketSphinx to listen, but it is unable to recognise the speech because of this(even though AVaudiosession is paused).<br />
Please let me know what i have to do to make it work in this kind of scenarios.</p>
