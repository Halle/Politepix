						<![CDATA[
						<p>I&#8217;m creating language model files dynamically. </p>
<p>The first &#8220;StartListeningWith&#8230;&#8221; (Model A) works great with no problem.</p>
<p>When I &#8220;ChangeLanguageModelToFile&#8221; (Model B), It changes without a problem also.</p>
<p>But, when I try to change the Language Model for the second time (to Model C) it starts having recognition problems. It keeps getting empty hypothesis back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering, is it designed this way, or is it a programming error on my part?</p>
<p>I tried suspending/resuming while changing language models, etc. I couldn&#8217;t get it to work the second time changing around. I&#8217;m not using threaded model. If it worked the first time, I don&#8217;t see why second time should be a problem.</p>
<p>Please help. Thank you.</p>

						<p>I seemed to have answered my own question. I had to change LM File names between language models. Thanks.</p>
