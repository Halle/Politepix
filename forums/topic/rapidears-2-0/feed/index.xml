						<p>I get a very quick response in rapidEarsDidReceiveLiveSpeechHypothesis but it is not quickly reporting a final hypothesis in rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis. This is also using RuleORama 2.0 which I didn&#8217;t see anything had changed. Also, the RuleORama page doesn&#8217;t have the OE additions to the instructions (just a heads up).</p>
<p>2014-12-09 16:23:27.504 App[2322:685824] Pocketsphinx has detected speech.<br />
2014-12-09 16:23:30.851 App[2322:685824] rapidEarsDidReceiveLiveSpeechHypothesis: TEST<br />
2014-12-09 16:23:53.001 App[2322:685824] Pocketsphinx has detected a second of silence, concluding an utterance.<br />
2014-12-09 16:23:53.868 App[2322:685824] rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis: TEST<br />
2014-12-09 16:23:53.868 App[2322:685824] TEST HEARD</p>
<p>This took 23 seconds to return. Any thoughts on this?</p>

						<p>Actually, I didn&#8217;t notice but I see what is happening. It is just listening in rapidEarsDidReceiveLiveSpeechHypothesis: and not returning in rapidEarsDidReceiveFinishedSpeechHypothesis on my silence. I didn&#8217;t see anything that could be directly set to affect this. VAD settings didn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>

						<p>The first thing I would check here is to make sure you really replaced the acoustic model when you went through the upgrade process.  If that doesn&#8217;t help, can you turn on OELogging and setVerboseRapidEars:TRUE and show the output? And please show your RapidEars settings.</p>

						<p>Not sure which one was the culprit but I removed all of the new frameworks files and re-imported them. Everything seems to be in order after some sleep. Carry on nothing to see here. =)</p>

						<p>In case this has returned, OpenEars 2.01 and RapidEars 2.01 out now have a fix for similar symptoms.</p>
