						<p>Hey,<br />
 I am using OpenEars framework for speech recognition, It works for words that have already added in OpenEars1.languagemodel file, and here OpenEars1.dic file is also used. My problem is that i want to add few words in that files therefore i can recognise newly add words.<br />
I searched but don&#8217;t know where and how to add more words ?<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

						<p>OK, if the explanations in the tutorial, and the OpenEars documentation, and the sample app comments aren&#8217;t clear, I regretfully can&#8217;t help further. I would be rewriting the explanations and sample code from those sources, just in a different place.</p>
