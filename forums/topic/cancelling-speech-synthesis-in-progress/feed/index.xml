						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there some way to to cancel speech synthesis in progress and replace it with synthesis for a new text. Currently it looks like if speech synthesis is in progress all calls to &#8216;say:withVoice:&#8217; are ignored.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve looked at FliteController.h and there is no API that exposes this functionality. I am looking for a way to flush the current synthesis queue and start synthesis for new text.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&#8211;MB.</p>

						<p>There is a method interrupTalking in FliteController. However there is a comment in the header file before this method.</p>
<p>// Handling not doing voice recognition on Flite speech, do not directly call</p>
<p>It looks like its just calling [AvAudioPlayer stop] and setting it to nil. So it should be safe to call.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&#8211;MB</p>
<p>PS: Is there some way to look at the source code of FliteController.m? I just want to look at the implementation to find out what the methods in the header file do. I don&#8217;t want to modify anything. For e.g. I want to find out how AVAudioPlayerDelegate is implemented etc.</p>

						<p>You can look at all of the source for OpenEars and modify it for your app. It&#8217;s compiled into a framework for your convenience, but it is all shipped with the distribution as source. Here is another discussion of this question that might be helpful to you: <a href="/forums/topic/interrupting-speech/">/forums/topic/interrupting-speech/</a></p>
