						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m developing an app for recording videos with AV Foundation API (AVCaptureSession), with vocal commands included. I&#8217;ve troubles in capturing videos when OpenEars is running, the recording doesn&#8217;t start.<br />
I tried also to stop listening before starting video capture, but it doesn&#8217;t work. Instead, if I remove OpenEars from the app, the recording works very well. </p>
<p>Can you help me?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t possible with the current version of OpenEars, although I am working on it for the upcoming version 2.0 (I don&#8217;t know when it will ship). </p>
<p>The issue is that AVCaptureSession requires a completely different audio session from OpenEars and vice versa, so they currently cannot each allow the other access to the singular audio stream successfully. </p>
<p>This is expected behavior since there are no examples of iOS audio objects in which two instantiated objects can make simultaneous use of a singular audio stream, but nonetheless I&#8217;m working on trying to make this possible with OpenEars and AVCaptureSession.</p>

						<p>With OS7.1 I&#8217;ve got it working (check my previous thread).<br />
With OS8.0 didn&#8217;t work anymore, but I was able to start it by turning off the audio on the AVCaptureSession</p>

						<p>Even the previous approach with iOS7 was not going to have a compatible sample rate, so it would heavily impact recognition accuracy. The next version should do better with this scenario.</p>

						<p>True. The only workaround I see is to turn off the audio recording in the session.</p>
<p>@Halle: Is there at least a very rough estimation of the 2.0 release?</p>

						<p>OK, with the 2.0 version out, I&#8217;d be very interested to know whether it coexists better with your video objects out of the box. If you have any complex workarounds, please remove them so they don&#8217;t affect the quality of your results using the current stock version. Thanks!</p>
