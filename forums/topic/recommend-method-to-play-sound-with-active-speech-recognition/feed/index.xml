						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Just wanted to thank you again for getting arm64 supported. I&#8217;m just about to submit my app to the App Store for approval, but I&#8217;m running into a problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a couple of very short sound effects that play in response to user input. Since I&#8217;ve got the speech recognizer running in the background, I&#8217;m having a hard time figuring out how to also play small sound effects.</p>
<p>Do you have a recommended way or sample code on the acceptable way to play short .wav files?</p>
<p>Other info: I&#8217;m not using the FliteController at all. Not instantiated or created anywhere. Only using PocketsphinxController with the flags:<br />
outputAudio = NO;<br />
audioSessionMixing = YES;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried setting the audioMode flag to &#8220;VoiceChat&#8221; with no difference.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help and suggestions.</p>
<p>Wes</p>

						<p>Hi Wes,</p>
<p>Have you tried playing them with an AVAudioPlayer, for instance, ones that are properties of the view controller that you can load and prepareToPlay in advance so they aren&#8217;t laggy? It&#8217;s the only audio object that has absolutely no issues I&#8217;m aware of being played while the PlayAndRecord audio session is in place. You can also easily suspend and resume before and after playback so it doesn&#8217;t interfere with recognition accuracy. Let me know if that works for you.</p>

						<p>Hi Halle,</p>
<p>Perfect, thanks. I can confirm that using AVAudioPlayer works as well as another method I found where you make a call to:</p>
<p>OSStatus error = AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID((CFURLRef)aFileURL, &amp;aSoundID);</p>
<p>with your sound URL to create a system sound ID that can be played back later using:</p>
<p>AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(_soundID);</p>
<p>Just for completeness, while both worked, I found that the AudioServices method worked the best in my scenario. </p>
<p>Thanks Halle!<br />
Wes</p>

						<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>For clarity, I did have to set the .audioMode flag of the PocketsphinxController object to @&#8221;VoiceChat&#8221; in order to get iOS to play and record from the mic.</p>

						<p>Good to know &#8212; there was an old bug preventing AudioServicesPlaySystemSound from working with PlayAndRecord, so I&#8217;m happy to hear that it&#8217;s working better now.</p>

<p>Aha, maybe having VoiceChat available now is the reason this works.</p>

						<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you confirm I can&#8217;t use SoundSystem when Openears is started ?<br />
Before startListening call, I can play my sound with:<br />
AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(answerSounds[0]);</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t work even if I suspend recognition. No error but I can&#8217;t hear the sound. Do you have a trick ? I&#8217;ve to use AVAudioPlayer way ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not using PlayAndRecord, juste simple recognition.</p>

						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>PlayAndRecord is always used with recognition so this system sounds bug is always in effect when performing recognition. I can confirm that if you want to have sound effects it&#8217;s necessary to queue them up in an AVAudioPlayer by instantiating them and calling prepareToPlay.</p>
