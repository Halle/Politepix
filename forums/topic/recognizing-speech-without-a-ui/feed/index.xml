						<p>I&#8217;d like to recognize speech as a background task and launch the UI when a certain word is spoken. Is this something that OpenEars and the iOS framework allow for?</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>Meaning that you want the app to be backgrounded, or that you want an app without a visual UI?</p>

						<p>Correct Halle. I want my app to be running all the time in the background and listening on the mic. When a particular word is spoken, I&#8217;d like the background task to launch the app&#8217;s UI.</p>

						<p>OK, thanks for clarifying. This isn&#8217;t something I actively support (meaning it isn&#8217;t in my testbed and I don&#8217;t provide API for it or present it as a feature, so if it changes between OS versions I can&#8217;t extend a ton of help with that) but some people have gotten it working. Search around these forums for the keyword &#8220;background&#8221; and you should find some information on the details.</p>
