						<p>I noticed that when using OpenEars it seems to change the equalisation settings on my audio playback &#8211; either that or the speech synthesis component has reconfigured my audio output somehow (perhaps changed to mono instead of stereo?).</p>
<p>All I would like to do is use OpenEars for speech recognition. Would it be the speech synthesis that is changing my audio output quality? Do I have to include speech synthesis if I only want to do speech recognition?</p>

						<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>This is probably happening as a result of the audio session settings for PocketsphinxController. I think it can&#8217;t be changed if you are doing the playback and recognition intermittently in the same session.</p>

						<p>So would this mean that I&#8217;d have to destroy the PocksetsphixController object when not in use and re-instantiate when required? Apologies for the lack of detail &#8211; I don&#8217;t have my Mac with me at the moment.. just trying to proactively plan my next lot of home development activities. :-)</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>How it works is that when PocketsphinxController is in its recognition loop, it continually reasserts its own audio session requirements because it would stop working if it didn&#8217;t. So it might be sufficient to just stop listening and then start again; you might need to experiment. Suspend and resume aren&#8217;t an option because the loop isn&#8217;t actually exited when they are used.</p>
