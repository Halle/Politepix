						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to edit the above so that it has all the other info from the mis-post in the instructions topic and then I will remove that post. Can you let me know what other audio or video processes (or other significant processes that could affect the audio session) are happening in these sections:</p>
<pre>
2013-10-22 08:22:12.058 baka[804:c07] ReStartd the Show

</pre>
<p>And what is the audio input device in use?</p>
<p>One last question about this:</p>
<pre>
>>>>>>>>>> I never returns from that >>>>>>>> Someone started a permanent noise or sound
</pre>
<p>Do you mean that the noise or sound is ongoing for the entire period in which no hypothesis gets returned? If the sound never stops and it is louder than the level that was calibrated as being speech, we can&#8217;t do anything about that since it means that the user has entered an environment in which recognition of their own speech is no longer possible due to conflicting noise at the same level as speech. But if the noise appears and then stops, and no end of speech is ever again detected, that would be a possible issue.</p>

						<p>Tx a lot:<br />
F:what other audio or video processes (or other significant processes that could affect the audio session) are happening in these sections:?<br />
A: the app plays audio short mp3 using<br />
 audioPlayer = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:modelURL error:&amp;error];<br />
Someone  is checking in // that to detect resource abuse :)<br />
Video usage is more than simple a mere set of jpegs being displayed<br />
F:Do you mean that the noise or sound is ongoing for the entire period in which no hypothesis gets returned? If the sound &#8230;?<br />
A: We tried both ,but we do understand the permanent and high volume problem ,so we discarded that<br />
Problem is   &#8230; But if the noise appears and then stops, and no end of speech is ever again detected ..<br />
Sometimes end of speech is detected ,but on many cases no.<br />
I have in front of mine :</p>
<p>Iphone that recovers from sound &#8216;storm&#8217;<br />
Iphone that dont recover from SAME sound storm<br />
IPAD   that dont recover from SAME sound storm </p>

						<p>Fresh Update :<br />
My Ladinen-Chinese partner  (yes a Chinese from BOZEN :))<br />
found with patience that IPAD recovers after a long period and restarts<br />
listening ,of course after u stop the sound &#8230;..<br />
If we could get a better timeout that would be enough as we are testing this<br />
with pro earphones<br />

						<blockquote><p>the app plays audio short mp3 using<br />
audioPlayer</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be OK, but a) are you suspending/resuming when you play this or is it being submitted as part of the sound to be recognized, and b) is it being actively played in the timeframe in which you get the recognition that never returns a hypothesis?</p>
<blockquote><p>Video usage is more than simple a mere set of jpegs being displayed</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this displayed with any kind of video object, or is it displayed with UIImage?</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem is … But if the noise appears and then stops, and no end of speech is ever again detected</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this also happen with the sample app that ships with the distribution if you don&#8217;t make any changes to it?</p>
<p>Which acoustic model are you using?</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m envious of your partner; Bozen is a lovely place. OK, so does that mean that we can say that eventually recognition is performed when a very long sound stops, but it is unpleasantly slow because it is finally scanning all of what has become an extremely long utterance? In that case, maybe you can get your solution from this thread about a similar issue, in which we found a workaround: <a href="/forums/topic/cancel-current-processing-on-pause-detected/">/forums/topic/cancel-current-processing-on-pause-detected/</a></p>
<p>I might end up adding this feature to the main distribution since it seems like in keyword spotting mode, few developers want such long utterances to be completely analyzed.</p>

we ll check and come back<br />
but some a.<br />

a ) we stop recognition while the device talks ( in radio we call half  duplex f) s this displayed with any kind of video object, or is it displayed with UIImage?<br />
a)   _topImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:self.bounds];<br />
_botImageView =&#8230;.<br />

 Spanish ) and same thing happens</p>

						<p>Hi gborgia,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing some more research on the underlying reason behind these occasional long background noise recognitions now. My current theory is that they happen intermittently because of a useless calibration due to the audio intake during calibration being too short or undifferentiated. Is the issue you reported here alleviated at all if you set PocketsphinxController&#8217;s calibrationTime property to 2 or 3?</p>
