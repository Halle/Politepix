						<p>Hello, Halle.</p>
<p>I have some questions.<br />
That&#8217;s about the speed at &#8220;initWithPitch:pitch:speed:transform:&#8221; method of &#8220;NeatSpeechVoice&#8221; class.</p>
<p>The speed value is used to a scale of -1.0 &lt;&minus;&gt; 1.0.<br />
Then, based on 0.0, how many times as fast as that in -1.0 &lt;&minus;&gt; 1.0?<br />
I would like to show in the format like &#8220;x2.0&#8221; to the user.</p>
<p>When changing the speed value,<br />
Is the amount of change fluctuated with a constant acceleration,<br />
 or with a constant velocity?<br />
Please let me know if there is a calculation formula.</p>
<p>And, do the speed value affect the waiting time at the punctuation marks?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Hitoshi</p>

						<p>Hello Hitoshi,</p>
<p>It is dependent on encapsulated details of the voice (it is specific to each voice) and it is also subject to change, so I can&#8217;t easily answer this question with a formula. If you&#8217;re curious about this for a specific voice, I think the full logging might give you enough information that you could time the playback and find out.</p>

						<p>Hi, Halle.</p>
<p>I see.<br />
I&#8217;ll investigate the speed by actually reproducing sample sounds. </p>
<p>Thank you for your qucik reply.</p>
