						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Where is the best place to suspend listening at first start? I&#8217;ve tried various places but it&#8217;s ignored the first time (right after startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath&#8211;) and suspending/resuming works fine after that&#8230; </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a good design for various reasons to suspend immediately after starting. What is the design consideration that is leading to that requirement?</p>

						<p>Ok, just checking if it&#8217;s an easy option, but agreed and I&#8217;ll rethink my design. I built it into it&#8217;s own NSObject (gui-less, using NSnotifications to talk to the current viewcontroller) so I can activate it anywhere, and in my case when I first launch the app I load it in viewDidload (with a background queue because there is a 5-7 second delay when you do the &#8220;startListening&#8221;) but then I need it suspended until the right time in my app.</p>
<p>So thinking about it more, I&#8217;ll load it on the first time it&#8217;s needed&#8230;</p>

						<p>OK, the new 2.0 design is that OEPocketsphinxController is a singleton, so the design feature of being able to control it from anywhere is now built-in and since there is no more calibration it starts very quickly, so I&#8217;d just upgrade to 2.0 and see if the updated design solves some of these problems for you out of the box without needing to start and then suspend.</p>

						<p>Cool, did the update to 2.0&#8211;</p>
<p>starts in 2.8 seconds on an iPod touch, 1.5s on iPhone 5, 0.85s on iPad air2</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll lazy-instantiate it on the first request for speech recognition &amp; call it a day, thanks!</p>

						<p>OK, I&#8217;m actually just seeing a .5 second startup on my test devices, so there might even be something delaying that for you which could be reduced with some troubleshooting.</p>
