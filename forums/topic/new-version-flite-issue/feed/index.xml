						<p>Hi :)<br />
Since getting my new iPad on iOS 6, I can&#8217;t get Flite to work since I had to<br />
also download a new version of Openears with the commands changed.<br />
I have followed the instructions, and the code compiles.<br />
When it comes time to speak, there is a pause, but nothing is spoken.</p>
<p>It looks like the old framework files were not removed from the project properly.<br />
Maybe this is a problem.<br />
There is a compiler warning saying it can&#8217;t find Openears in the location that<br />
the old version used to be, even though those files are deleted.<br />
Any help appreciated.</p>

						<p>Seems I solved my own problem.<br />
I found out how to remove the references in build settings, but that wasn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I was using this with the older code:<br />
[code]<br />
    // [self.fliteController say:[NSString stringWithFormat:@&#8221; &#8220;] withVoice:self.slt];<br />
    // looks like this flite kickstart is no longer needed<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>I found that the sentence I wanted spoken came out sooner, if this was sent shortly beforehand.<br />
In the new OpenEars, it stops it saying what&#8217;s coming next, and you hear nothing.</p>
<p>Cheers, Art.</p>

						<p>Heh, I was just coming in here to see if I could find the old guide to definitively removing the old version somewhere, when you posted that you sorted it out yourself :) . Nice work and thank you for updating me.</p>
