										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another big release day! <a href="/openears">OpenEars 1.2.1</a> is out, adding the very-suddenly-required armv7s slice and fixing the bug in which speech from right before a call to suspendRecognition will be processed after recognition is resumed. Downloadable at <a href="/openears">/openears</a>. Also released today is <a href="/rapidears">RapidEars 1.1</a>, which further refines many improvements of the past few versions and is stable, fast, resource-frugal and behaves better when changing language models and when suspending/resuming. You can read more about it and try out the demo at <a href="/rapidears">/rapidears</a>. If you&#8217;ve tried an earlier version, <a href="/rapidears">RapidEars 1.1</a> is really worth a second look.</p>
<p>[politepix-blog-inline-text-ad]</p>
<p>Politepix has also released a new paid plugin called <a href="/rejecto">Rejecto</a>, which makes your apps more accurate when you use OpenEars and RapidEars by tuning out words that aren&#8217;t in your language model. As usual it&#8217;s easy to get started with but it has a lot of knobs to twiddle if you want to optimize your model as far as possible. Check it out at <a href="/rejecto">/rejecto</a>.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re trying these new tools out, why not make it easy on yourself and visit Politepix&#8217;s new <a href="/openears/tutorial">tutorial tool</a>, which will get you up and running with your OpenEars app about 5 minutes. It&#8217;s found at <a href="/openears/tutorial">/openears/tutorial</a> and it includes instructions for all the OpenEars classes and all of the plugins too!</p>
