										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated for Xcode 6: I now use the following bash one-liner:</p>
<pre style="width:490px;">
open -R `find ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices -type d -depth 5 -name "*.app" -print0 | xargs -0 stat -f "%m %N" | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -f2- -d" "`
</pre>
<p>Read on for some historical AppleScript which applies to Xcode versions previous to 6.</p>
<div class="woo-sc-box  note   ">If you&#8217;re interested in this, you might also enjoy checking out <a href="/openears">OpenEars</a>, Politepix&#8217;s free iOS SDK for doing offline speech recognition without using the network, now featuring <a href="/2014/04/10/openears-1-7-introducing-dynamic-grammar-generation/">the ability to generate rules-based recognition grammars dynamically at runtime</a>!</div>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another Applescript* tool</strong> for dealing with the Simulator, since I seem to be on an Applescript/Simulator kick**. Maybe I&#8217;m the only one with this problem: a common use of the Simulator for me is testing code that writes out to the Documents folder of the app. And yet, it&#8217;s always an unpleasant process to locate the app&#8217;s Simulator install folder inside of the Application Support/Simulator folder. It&#8217;s not always 100% obvious which SDK folder I ought to be looking in, the containing folder name changes, it&#8217;s not self-evidently named, etc. So, I have an Applescript that just finds and opens the Simulator install folder for whatever Simulator app I built and ran last.</p>
<p>[politepix-blog-inline-text-ad]</p>
<p>Or at least, I had an Applescript, but it was dog-slow. But I recently asked for help on MacScripter <a href="https://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=140141">here</a> and it&#8217;s now optimized into a speed demon thanks to Hank and Stefan.  The script, to be entered and saved in your Applescript Editor:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp,gutter:false, smart-tabs:true,wrap-lines:false;">

# By StefanK at MacScripter: https://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=140141

property findtype : quoted form of "kMDItemContentType = \"com.apple.application-bundle\""

set simulatorFolder to POSIX path of (path to application support folder from user domain) & "iPhone Simulator/"
set appFiles to paragraphs of (do shell script "mdfind -onlyin " & quoted form of simulatorFolder & " " & findtype)
if appFiles is not {} then
	set mostRecentApp to item 1 of appFiles
	tell application "Finder" to reveal ((POSIX file mostRecentApp) as alias)
	tell application "Finder" to activate
end if</pre>
<p>Of you can just <a href="/wp-content/uploads/Find%20Most%20Recent%20Simulator%20Build.zip">download</a> it as an already-saved app if you prefer (it can still be opened and edited in Applescript Editor).</p>
<p>Put it in the dock and click it when you want to see the install folder. I hope it spares you as much annoyance as it spares me. Tip of the hat to MacScripter and regulus6633 and StefanK.</p>
<p>*&#8221;What&#8217;s the deal with all the Applescript?&#8221; you ask. Look, I just want to be well-practiced when Apple rolls out the Applescript Store at WWDC this year.</p>
<p>**My last AppleScript/Simulator <a href="/2011/04/25/low-memory-warning-bombardment-tool/">post</a> was linked on Alex Curlyo&#8217;s blog and it led to a discussion that raised <a href="https://www.alexcurylo.com/blog/2011/04/26/tip-low-memory-warnings/">two even better suggestions for accomplishing the same task</a> which are now part of my standard workflow.</p>
