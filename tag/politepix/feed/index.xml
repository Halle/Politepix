										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am extraordinarily happy to announce that OpenEars 1.0 is <a href="/openears">out now</a>. This version has <strong>so</strong> many fixes and new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-fast, ultra-easy install</li>
<li>All-C language modelling and 3x faster phonetic lookup fallback method for vastly faster dynamic language model generation</li>
<li>Language model generation is now tuned to creating contextual models from long sentences with improved recognition accuracy</li>
<li>Only runs with ios 4 and 5 since the only devices that need 3 can&#8217;t use OpenEars due to hardware shortcomings. This allows optimizations that make OpenEars faster.</li>
<li>ARC/LLVM compatible</li>
<li>General recognition accuracy is improved, recognition speed is much faster in release versions due to LLVM</li>
<li>Uses the latest .7 versions of all of the Sphinx libraries</li>
<li>Calibration takes half the time and is configurable as an OpenEarsConfig.h constant</li>
<li>Silence detection period is configurable programmatically</li>
<li>It should no longer be necessary to do anything special in order to use iOS media objects such as AVPlayer.</li>
<li>It is possible to set OpenEars to programmatically mix with background sounds such as iPod music, although this is not a default setting.</li>
<li>OpenEars no longer attempts to start Pocketsphinx on a device that has no audio input available</li>
<li>OpenEars now cleans dynamic language model arrays on input for problematic whitespace</li>
<li>JSGF now has better perception </li>
<li>Dynamic JSGF switching has been added</li>
<li>The AudioSessionManager is now only used internally, since it was the main cause of configuration difficulty for most developers. OpenEars now manages the audio session automagically. Don&#8217;t call AudioSessionManager directly any more, it&#8217;s no longer a developer-facing class of OpenEars.</li>
<li>All reported bugs fixed</li>
<li>OpenEars has a license change and is no longer EFF/OSI-defined OSS. It is free as in beer so we&#8217;ll start calling it shared source instead of open source. The big license changes paraphrased (please read the new license since you are agreeing to it when you use the framework): you can&#8217;t redistribute it as source, using it in something other than an app requires permission and special licensing, contribution terms are spelled out. Although this affects a miniscule number of developers that have used OpenEars so far, it&#8217;s a change, so if absolutely anyone wants to talk this over with me/ask more about it, I sincerely welcome you to get in touch via the contact page and I will answer and discuss any good-faith question.</li>
</ul>
<p>[politepix-blog-inline-text-ad]</p>
<p>I really hope that you enjoy this easier, faster and more flexible 1.0 version of OpenEars!</p>
