Hey Brian,

Cool to hear from you, VocalKit is great.  If you ever get a chance to try OpenEars out I&#039;d love to get your feedback.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Halle, 
     The Library looks great.   I&#039;m the author of VocalKit which is a quick wrapper around pocket sphinx, but it was mostly a slight cleanup of a spike I did and never had much of a reason to work more on it.   A lot of people are using it and I&#039;m going to start pointing them in your direction.   I don&#039;t have much time to work on it and your project looks great.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jake,

Thanks!  Let me know how it works for you.  

I think it might not be too big of a deal to get OpenEars working with Spanish, with the caveat that I haven&#039;t attempted any acoustic model implementations for other languages.  If you&#039;d like to move the conversation over to the forums at /forums we can take a look at what is involved in that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Halle - this is awesome. Plan to start working with this over the next couple of weeks. Does it work with other languages besides English? Would it be a major undertaking for me to extend it to spanish? thanks!]]></description>
