You are correct, I&#039;ve edited the code in the post. Thanks for catching that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this... trying to figure it out. 

There&#039;s a typo here, no? 
if((sampleDB == sampleDB) &#038;&#038; (sampleDB = -DBL_MAX))

should be 

if((sampleDB == sampleDB) &#038;&#038; (sampleDB != -DBL_MAX))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Waruna,

-74.0 means no input at all. So, you only need to troubleshoot why there is no rendered content in the buffers that are in your callback. All Audio Unit and Audio Session code has a method of error checking (including the buffer callback), so log that error checking code and it should tell you what is happening.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Thanks for your resource full article . However when tired this example i always get -74.0 values. Do you what could be the reason for this. 
I used recordingCallback function instead of AudioUnitRenderCallback could this be the problem? 
Appreciate your answer or any suggestion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ants,

I&#039;d guess that you&#039;re getting unexpected results because of a different input besides a signed 16-bit integer using the full range of samples that this assumes. Since you&#039;re getting floats out, am I correct that your input is a float value?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Halle,

A couple of questions. Firstly the if that checks for rational number and isn&#039;t infinite

if((sampleDB == sampleDB) &#038;&#038; (sampleDB = -DBL_MAX)) { 

Shouldn&#039;t that be sampleDB != -DBL_MAX ? I seem to be getting values of DBOFFSET.

If I change to != then I get values out but the range is really small. I tried changing DBOFFSET to -94 however all that did was change the offset (DUH). In my case it seems to be around -9.7 with only slight variation between -10 &#038; -9.6. Is that the low pass filter that is having this effect?

Thanks Ants]]></description>

Pitch detection is going to be a little outside of the topic of this blog post, but here is a good SO thread that should get you started and then some: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7623166/avaudio-detect-note-pitch-etc-iphone-xcode-objective-c]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello hale,

Ive readed true out all the comments. But one thing I just cant figure out. If I  want the meter to show me between 400 and 500 Hz what is the best way to get to work with this. The purpose of this is so you can tune instruments with this meter. I hope you still read this topic.

Thanks,
Thom]]></description>

It has a role that is explained in the comments. It&#039;s a quick way of throwing out any NaN values that might come through for unforeseen reasons. Here&#039;s another example for you: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2109282/119717]]></description>
